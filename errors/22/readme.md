# Map does not support latitude/longitude

The loaded map does not support latitude/longitude functionality. This is only
supported with maps from the
[official Highmaps map collection](https://code.highcharts.com/mapdata)
from version 1.1.0 onwards. If you are using a custom map, consider using the
[Proj4js](https://proj4js.org)
library to convert between projections.
