# Unknown time zone

This error occurs if the browser doesn't recognize the [timezone](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/time.timezone)
option. Possible workarounds are to use a time zone definition that all browsers
recognize, or create your own [getTimezoneOffset](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/time.getTimezoneOffset)
callback.
