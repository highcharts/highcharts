# Changelog for Highcharts v11.2.0 (2023-10-30)

- Upgraded the build pipeline to benefit from new language features. Bundles are now compiled to ES2020 by the TypeScript compiler (`*.src.js` files), and minified by swc (`*.js` files).
- Added support for multiple data labels on pie slices.
- Added new option, [sankey.nodeAlignment](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.sankey.nodeAlignment) for the Sankey series to specify which side of the chart nodes should align.
- Added new option, [sankey.linkColorMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.sankey.linkColorMode).
- Added feature to allow different symbols for upper/lower markers in area range and dumbbell charts. See [#14024](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/14024).
- Set the default [series.lineWidth](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.lineWidth) of line graphs to to 2px for better accessibility.
