## Upgrade notes
- Legend positioning: Since version 2.1 Highcharts is aware of the size of the titles and legend and will try to make room for these in the chart's margins. When upgrading from older versions, this may lead to too great margins depending on where your legend is positioned. To prevent this, set a new option, floating to true in your legend options. Furthermore, the x and y values of the legend position is now relative to the chart.spacingTop and chart.spacingLeft etc. properties instead of the chart's outer edge.

## Bug fixes
