# Changelog for Highcharts v12.2.0 (2025-04-07)

- Added support for native `color-mix`. This means colors don't have to be parsed and analyzed in order to allow tweening and modification. Which means full support for CSS variables, named colors and all color definitions known to the browser. [Read more in the docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/colors#solid-colors).
- Added experimental flag, [HTMLElement.useForeignObject](https://www.highcharts.com/samples/highcharts/members/renderer-usehtml-foreignobject). When true, labels with the `useHTML` flag are rendered inside a `<foreignObject>` in SVG, instead of the traditional parallel div structure.
- Added ESM bundles for dynamic imports. Use `highcharts/esm/highcharts.js` or [load from our CDN](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/installation-with-esm#dynamic-imports-from-cdn).
- Added new options, [tooltip.fixed](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/tooltip.fixed) and [tooltip.position](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/tooltip.position), as a simple declarative way of keeping the tooltip fixed.
- Added the [nullInteraction](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.nullInteraction) option for more series types than before. Null points will now support data labels and tooltips.
- Added [language modules](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/internationalization) for some selected languages, as well as a structure to continue building on.
- Added level headers in treemap as separate cells through the [dataLabels.headers](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.treemap.dataLabels.headers) option. Followed up with improved layout control with the new [treemap.groupPadding](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.treemap.groupPadding) and [treemap.nodeSizeBy](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.treemap.nodeSizeBy) options.
