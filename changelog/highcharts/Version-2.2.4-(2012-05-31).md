- Added paging for the legend. Added [legend.navigation](/ref/#legend-navigation) options set.
- Added [tooltip.positioner](/ref/#tooltip-positioner) option.
- Refactored major parts of Highcharts by splitting the Chart object into separate prototypes. This eases extendability as the objects are available from the outside, and individual methods and properties can be overridden.
- Worked around issue with overlapping shadows on stacked columns. Shadow elements are now cut off.
- Made the tooltip follow the mouse position for shared tooltips with more than 1 series. This fixes problems with the tooltip being rendered close to the top series (or alternatively in another computed middle position) when the user is actually hovering another series. [Issue #424](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/424).
- Worked around compatibility issue with jQuery 1.8 preview.
- Removed warnings on accessing layerX and layerY in Chrome.
- Added time-aware xDateFormat for tooltip headers in datetime axes. Added tooltip.dateTimeLabelFormat option. [Issue #568](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/568).
