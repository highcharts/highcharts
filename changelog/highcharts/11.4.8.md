# Changelog for Highcharts v11.4.8 (2024-08-29)


## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#21165](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21165), series didn't render properly when the chart height was very large.
- Fixed [#21106](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21106), series clipped on boost disabled and increased the chart size.
- Fixed [#21734](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21734), minor ticks were wrongly distributed with multiple axes or when [tickAmount](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.tickAmount) was set.
- Fixed [#21521](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21521), plot band labels and plot line labels would overlap if positioned too close. Added `inside` and `allowOverlap` options to the [Axis.plotBands.label](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.plotBands.label) options.
- Fixed [#20499](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/20499), data labels failed to apply width in styled mode.
- Fixed [#21205](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21205), offline PDF exporting was broken by attempted erroneous child node removal when the chart contained text paths.
- Fixed [#21241](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21241), accessibility could not be dynamically enabled or disabled.
- Fixed [#21188](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21188) and [#21510](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21510), hidden divs with special CSS styles increased chart height by firing `ResizeObserver`.
- Fixed [#21650](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21650), the data module was not successfully updating the x-axis in some cases.
- Fixed [#21255](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21255), tooltip with [outside](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/tooltip.outside) rendered outside viewport, making `document.documentElement` expand.
- Fixed [#21605](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21605), legend text was not vertically aligned with the symbol.
