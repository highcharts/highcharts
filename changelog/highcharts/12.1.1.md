## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#22393](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/22393), the global `Highcharts.dateTime` function didn't pick the locale from the `html.lang` attribute, fell back to browser default.
- Fixed [#7873](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/7873), `min` and `max` settings in [exporting.chartOptions](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.chartOptions) axis options were not respected if the user had interacted with the axis.
- Fixed [#22402](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/22402), a regression in v12 causing wrong number formatting with [lang.decimalPoint](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/lang.decimalPoint) and [lang.thousandsSep](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/lang.thousandsSep) set to `,` and `.` respectively (European style).
- Fixed [#22394](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/22394), a regression in v12.1.0 causing bad alignment of text inside the reset zoom button.
