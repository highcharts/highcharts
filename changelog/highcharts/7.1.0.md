# Changelog for Highcharts v7.1.0 (2019-04-01)

- Added [Organization Chart](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/organization-chart) series type.
- Added [Item Chart](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/item-chart) series type for visualizing item counts and parliaments.
- Added [Dependency Wheel](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/dependency-wheel) series type.
- Added [Timeline](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/timeline) series type.
- Added [3D Pyramid](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/pyramid-3d) and [3D Funnel](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/funnel-3d) series types.
- [Accessibility](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-module) - improved experience for screen reader users, support for dynamic data and drilldown, as well as support for voice input software.
- Added `inactive` states to series and points, allowing other series to be dimmed when the user is hovering the data or legend. To bring back the old series dimming behavior, set [plotOptions.series.states.inactive.opacity](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.states.inactive.opacity) to 1.
- Added [levels](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.sankey.levels) to sankey series.
- Added `annotation.events`: `add`, `afterUpdate` and `remove`.
- Added full screen capabilities to exporting module.
- Added option [treemap.events.setRootNode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/treemap.events.setRootNode).
- Added option [xAxis.margin](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.margin) to ensure a distance between multiple axes on the same side.
- Added options [plotOptions.sankey.borderWidth](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.sankey.borderWidth) and `sankey.borderColor` for sankey nodes.
- Added force directed algorithm for improved packing of packed bubble charts. 
- Added support for [nested packed bubbles](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/packed-bubble-split/).
- Added [Verlet integration](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.networkgraph.layoutAlgorithm.integration) for network graphs. Generally improved network graph algorithms.
- Added data labels to links in network graphs.

## Upgrade notes
- Changed default X axis [tickWidth](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.tickWidth) option. Now tick marks are not rendered by default on category axes. Set the `tickWidth` to 1 to bring back the old behaviour.
- Renamed [plotOptions.treemap.drillUpButton](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.treemap.drillUpButton) to `traverseUpButton`.
- The new `inactive` state makes other items dim when when hovering a series. To bring back the old series dimming behavior, set [plotOptions.series.states.inactive.opacity](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.states.inactive.opacity) to 1.
