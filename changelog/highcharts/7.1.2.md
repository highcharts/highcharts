- Added auto alignment for solid gauges with two labels, see #10635.
- Improved performance for exporting packedbubble series.
- Added `series.nodes[index].remove()` method to networkgraph series to remove a node with all connected links. See #10565.
- Added support for percentage value in [yAxis.labels.distance](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.labels.distance) option for gauge series. See #10587.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed #9269, problems with grid axis update. Modified the columns logic in `GridAxis` to only add one column (the master) to the public axes array, and the remaining to an internal columns array.
- Fixed issue with wrong clipping of inverted scrollable plot area (see #10786).
- Fixed #8607, tooltip was masked at the edges of the chart when [chart.scrollablePlotArea](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.scrollablePlotArea) was active. Changed the [tooltip.outside](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/tooltip.outside) option to default to true when using scrollable plot area.
- Fixed #10741, overlapping networkgraph points were dissappearing.
- Fixed #8417, stacked columns were overlapping after update to 3D.
