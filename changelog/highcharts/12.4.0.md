# Changelog for Highcharts v12.4.0 (2025-09-04)

- Enhanced [bell-curve](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/bell-curve-series) and [histogram](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/histogram-series) series to accept the `data` option directly. An array of numbers can now be passed in, instead of being derived from another series in the chart.
- Added inlining of web fonts when exporting chart to image. View [live demo](https://www.highcharts.com/samples/highcharts/exporting/webfonts)
- Implemented more granular border radius options on polar bar charts and radial gauge plot bands, see [#23489](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/23489).
- Added support for boosted `series.colorByPoint` and fixed boosted halo, [#23370](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/23370).

## Upgrade notes
- The new font inlining feature can be bypassed by defining a `fontFamily` in [exporting.chartOptions](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.chartOptions). View [live demo](https://www.highcharts.com/samples/highcharts/exporting/webfonts-disabled).
