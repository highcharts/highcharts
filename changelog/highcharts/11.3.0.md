# Changelog for Highcharts v11.3.0 (2024-01-10)

- Implemented native handling of the [time.timezone](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/time.timezone) option, making the dependency on moment.js redundant.
- Added new options [colorAxis.width](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/colorAxis.width) and [colorAxis.height](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/colorAxis.height), allowing absolute or relative size. See [#17870](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/17870).
- Added new option [chart.axisLayoutRuns](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.axisLayoutRuns). It allows opting in for more predictable axis tick and label layout, at the cost of performance. See [#19794](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/19794).
- Added new default [legendSymbol](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.legendSymbol) for area series and its derivatives.

## Upgrade notes
- The [exporting.formAttributes](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.formAttributes) no longer works because the internal `post` function was replaced by the [fetch](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.fetchOptions) API. The [formAttributes](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.formAttributes) option can for some purposes be replaced with [exporting.fetchOptions](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.fetchOptions). See [the fetch article on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) for more information about possible options.
