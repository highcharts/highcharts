# Changelog for Highcharts v10.3.2 (2022-11-28)

- Refactored and simplified series group inversion logic. It is now simpler and more lightweight, and allows animating the transition between a non-inverted and inverted chart.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#17815](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/17815), the tooltip didn't receive styling from `series.options.className` in [styledMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.styledMode).
- Fixed [#17957](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/17957), data labels disappeared on point hover when `marker.enabled` was set to false.
- Fixed [#17991](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/17991), adding an invisible series caused error upon attempted exiting of fullscreen, when pattern-fill was set.
