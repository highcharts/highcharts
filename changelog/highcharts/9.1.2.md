- Exposed `Point.doDrilldown` and `Axis.drilldownCategory` as official API methods.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed #15841, a regression causing charts to crash some browsers where `Intl` was missing.
- Fixed #15869, boosted rendering sometimes crashed with multiple different chart types.
- Fixed #15845, selection marker showed without mousedown after export.
- Fixed #15843, shared tooltip with [stickOnContact](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/tooltip.stickOnContact) enabled did not always update position.
