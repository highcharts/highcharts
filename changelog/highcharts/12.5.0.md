# Changelog for Highcharts v12.5.0 (2026-01-12)

- Added support for dendrograms by allowing treegraph charts to be plotted against an x-axis. Read more about [dendrograms](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treegraph-chart#dendrogram) in the docs.
- Added new option, [legend.maxWidth](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/legend.maxWidth).
- Added the `color-scheme` CSS property across CSS files and Adaptive theme, to allow setting any color with the `light-dark()` CSS function.
- Added a warning when [chart.styledMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.styledMode) is enabled and the required CSS file is not loaded.
