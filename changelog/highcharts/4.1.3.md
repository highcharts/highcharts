# Changelog for Highcharts v4.1.3 (2015-02-27)
        

## Bug fixes
- Fixed #3900, duplicated Y axis in exported charts. Made export module more testable so it would have caught this error.
- Fixed #3898, zones incorrectly applied if outside axis range.
- Fixed #3895, error in title setter when setting a non-string value.
