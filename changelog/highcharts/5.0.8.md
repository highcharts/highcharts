- Added a refactored Boost module based on WebGL. Details and API to be announced.
- Added [animation](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.states.hover.animation) on graph mouse over and mouse out.
- Added hooks so that users can define their own log axis conversion functions, and can advertise that the log axis should allow [negative values](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/samples/highcharts/yaxis/type-log-negative/).
- Added new option, [solidgauge.rounded](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.solidgauge.rounded).
