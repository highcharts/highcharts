# Changelog for Highcharts v2.3.2 (2012-08-31)
        
- Added support for rotation of text when useHTML = true in modern browsers. #916.
- Added new option, [ignoreHiddenPoint](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/#plotOptions.pie.ignoreHiddenPoint), for pies.
- Changed the default line width for area range charts to 1 to avoid the area disappearing altogether in ranges where the min and max are equal. #1213.
- Reorganized VMLRenderer to move groups (divs) out of the viewport instead of toggling CSS visibility. This provides a faster and more compact fix for #61 and #586.
- Rendering performance improvement due to better caching of bounding box for texts, leading to less DOM traffic.
