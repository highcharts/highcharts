# Changelog for Highcharts v9.2.2 (2021-08-24)

- Added internal support for Google Sheets API v4, fixing stability problems with loading data from spreadsheets.

## Upgrade notes
- Existing setups with Google Sheets stopped working in August 2021 as Google phased out version 3 of their Google Sheets API. Highcharts has now been upgraded to version 4 of the API, but this will not work unless an API key is given in the [data.googleAPIKey](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.googleAPIKey) option. See the [comprehensive tutorial](https://handsondataviz.org/google-sheets-api-key.html) from Hands-On Data Visualization on how to obtain the key. Additionally, [data.googleSpreadsheetWorksheet](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.googleSpreadsheetWorksheet) is deprecated and replaced by [data.googleSpreadsheetRange](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.googleSpreadsheetRange), which allows for more detailed instructions on what data to load.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#16231](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/16231), a regresssion in v9.2 causing exporting not to work with [styledMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.styledMode) enabled.
