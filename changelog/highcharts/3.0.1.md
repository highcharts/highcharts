# Changelog for Highcharts v3.0.1 (2013-04-09)
        
- Added new option, [tooltip.followTouchMove](https://api.highcharts.com#tooltip.followTouchMove). When this is true, the tooltip can be moved by dragging a single finger across the chart, like in Highcharts 2. When it is false, dragging a single finger is ignored by the chart, and causes the whole page to scroll. This applies only when zooming is not enabled. #1644. #1662.
- Added internationalization for the Print chart text. #1656.
