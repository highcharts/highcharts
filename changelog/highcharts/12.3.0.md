# Changelog for Highcharts v12.3.0 (2025-06-21)

- Refactored the exporting modules (`exporting.js` and `offline-exporting.js`), making [local export](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.local) default for the PNG, JPEG, and SVG types.
- Introduced a new module
  [non-cartesian-zoom](https://code.highcharts.com/modules/non-cartesian-zoom.js),
  which adds zooming functionality to non-cartesian series like treegraph,
  sankey, wordcloud, pie and more.
- Added new theme, [adaptive.js](https://code.highcharts.com/themes/adaptive.js), supporting dark/light mode switching with the default palette in non-styled mode.

## Upgrade notes
- PNG, JPEG and SVG exports from the context menu will now be handled locally in the browser, unless explicitly disabled by setting [exporting.local](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.local) to false.
