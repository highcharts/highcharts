# Changelog for Highcharts v12.3.0 (2025-06-21)

- Refactored the exporting modules (`exporting.js` and `offline-exporting.js`), making [local export](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.local) default for the PNG, JPEG, and SVG types.
- Introduced a new module `non-cartesian-zoom`, which adds
  [zooming](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.zooming) functionality
  to non-cartesian series like treegraph, sankey, wordcloud, pie and more. Read
  more in [the docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/zooming).
- Added new theme, [adaptive.js](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/themes#dark-mode-in-highcharts-the-adaptive-theme), supporting dark/light mode switching with the default palette in non-styled mode.

## Upgrade notes
- PNG, JPEG and SVG exports from the context menu will now be handled locally in the browser, unless explicitly disabled by setting [exporting.local](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.local) to false.
