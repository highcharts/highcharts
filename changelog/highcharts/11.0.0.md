# Changelog for Highcharts v11.0.0 (2023-04-25)

- Design facelift with clearer, more vivid palette, added contrast for text labels and many minor visual changes.
- Added new series type, treegraph. [Read more in the docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treegraph-chart).
- Added new series type, [pictorial](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/pictorial).
- Removed support for IE 8 and older.
- Changed the default builds to ECMAScript version ES2016.
- Replaced SASS files for [styledMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.styledMode) with updated CSS files. Highcharts theming is now easier by supporting CSS variables as well as `prefers-color-scheme`. See [style by CSS](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/style-by-css).
- [Sonification module v2](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/sonification/getting-started) with many new features for audio charts, now part of the official API.
- Changed default [rotationMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.sunburst.dataLabels.rotationMode) to `circular` for sunburst data labels.
- Added [minorTicksPerMajor](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.minorTicksPerMajor) option for axes, see [#13338](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/13338).
- Added the `point.percentage` property for gauge charts, see [#18433](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/18433).
- Added `ResizeObserver` to the chart so it could adjust reflow on container size change, closes [#17924](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/17924).

## Upgrade notes
- To revert to the old design, use the theme defined in the [v10 theme sample](https://www.highcharts.com/samples/highcharts/members/theme-v10).
- The top-level `labels` option has been deprecated for a long time and is now removed. Use [Annotations](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/annotations-module) instead.
- Time-related settings on the [global](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/global) options structure are removed. Use the [time](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/time) options instead.
- The new version of the sonification module is not backwards compatible with the old, experimental module.
- The default builds were changed to ECMAScript version ES2016. See the [system requirements](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/system-requirements) on how to support IE11 and other legacy browsers.
- If you're using [chart.styledMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.styledMode), and your end users have [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) set to `dark` in their browsers, they may now be presented with dark-themed charts. The exception is if your CSS overrides the default coloring.
- Changed default [rotationMode](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.sunburst.dataLabels.rotationMode) to `circular` for sunburst data labels.
