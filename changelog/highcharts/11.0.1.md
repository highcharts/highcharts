- Added new option, [xAxis.crossing](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.crossing) and [yAxis.crossing](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.crossing), making it easier to create axis layout for mathematical plots.
- Added new option, [series.legendSymbol](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.series.legendSymbol). See [#18753](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/18753).
