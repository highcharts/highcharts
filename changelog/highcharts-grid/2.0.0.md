- **Grid:** Added filtering functionality.
- **Grid:** Added pagination functionality.
- **Grid:** Replaced the old column distribution modes (`full`, `fixed`, `mixed`) with new column resizing modes (`adjacent`, `independent`, `distributed`).

## Upgrade notes

- **Important Notice to Dashboards users:** `Datagrid` is now Grid Pro and no longer part of the Dashboards package. To use Grid Pro as a standalone component, you need to import it from an external library - either `Grid Pro` or `Grid Lite`. See the [Migration Guide](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/dashboards/grid-migration) for more details.
- The old column distribution modes (`full`, `fixed`, `mixed`) have been replaced with new column resizing modes (`adjacent`, `independent`, `distributed`).
- The previously deprecated `rendering.columns.distribution` option has been removed. To configure column resizing, use the new `rendering.columns.resizing.mode` option.
- If you used the resizing property in column definitions, move this logic to `rendering.columns.resizing.enabled` at the appropriate level.
- Review your project for any CSS rules targeting column widths and migrate those settings to the grid configuration options.
