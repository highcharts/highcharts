# Changelog for Highcharts Grid v2.1.0 (2025-12-09)

- **Grid:** Optimized `grid.update()` so that it now re-renders only the relevant elements in the DOM for the options being changed, rather than the entire container.
- **Grid:** Refactored and cleaned up CSS for greater consistency across elements.
- **Grid:** `@highcharts/grid-lite` and `@highcharts/grid-pro` npm libraries now export ES modules for client-side bundling on the default import path, instead of UMD bundles.
- **Grid:** Added column hover trigger on header cell mouseover.

## Bug fixes
- **Grid:** Fixed export methods so they respect column `dataType` settings.
- **Grid:** Fixed, the `insert` argument in the `dataTable.setRow()` method was not respected.
- **Grid:** Fixed, the custom cell `className` was missing when the cell `formatter` returned null.
- **Grid Pro:** Fixed sparkline cell update when previous value was `null`.
- **Grid Pro:** Fixed issue where the `afterEdit` event was not triggered when editing cells using view renderer content.
