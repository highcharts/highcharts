# Changelog for Highcharts Grid v2.0.1 (2025-11-03)

- **Grid:** Tweaked menu styling and demo code block colors to inherit the active theme, fixing unreadable elements in dark mode examples and popovers.
- **Grid:** Updated focus outlines for table cells to use the shared `--ig-focus-ring` token so keyboard navigation renders a single, consistent ring.
- **Grid Pro:** Introduced theme-aware variables for editable cell backgrounds and restored the select arrow appearance inside edited cells across light and dark themes.
- **Grid:** Exposed `--ig-default-font-family` and normalised the fallback stack so custom font overrides continue to cascade correctly.

## Bug fixes
- **Grid:** Fixed regression where `columns[].cells.className` and `columns[].header.className` were ignored for numeric columns.

## Upgrade notes

- **Important Notice**: If you upgrade directly from 1.x.x you should read the [migration guide](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/dashboards/grid-migration) for 2.0.0
