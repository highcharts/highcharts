# Changelog for Highcharts Dashboards v4.0.0 (2025-10-29)

- `Range Modifier` now defines the start-end slice of source table rows; all other range logic is covered by `Filter Modifier`.
  
## Upgrade notes

- **Important Notice:** `Datagrid` is now Grid Pro and no longer part of the Dashboards package. To use it as a component, you need to import it from an external library - either `Grid Pro` or `Grid Lite`. See the [Migration Guide](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/dashboards/grid-migration) for more details.
- Any workflows relying on `Range Modifier` beyond simple row slicing by row index must be migrated to the `Filter Modifier`.
