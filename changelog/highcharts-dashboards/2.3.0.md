## Bug fixes
- Fixed some smaller issues with the HTML component.
- Fixed [#21615](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21615), when the `useHTML` was enabled, content in a cell was not rendered correctly when scrolling.
- Fixed [#21280](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/21280), it was impossible to set the component active state, so added `isAcitve` flag.
- Fixed [parseDate](https://api.highcharts.com/dashboards/data.parseDate) in `DataConverter` was private.
- Fixed, added missing `DataConverter` type in `DataConnector`.
- Added missing utility method to the `Dashboards` namespace.
