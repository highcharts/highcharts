- Added demonstration of async data loading in Highstock
- Added support for rotation of text when useHTML = true in modern browsers. [Issue #916](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/916).
- Changed the default line width for area range charts to 1 to avoid the area disappearing altogether in ranges where the min and max are equal. [Issue #1213](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1213).
- Reorganized VMLRenderer to move groups (divs) out of the viewport instead of toggling CSS visibility. This provides a faster and more compact fix for #61 and #586.
- Rendering performance improvement due to better caching of bounding box for texts, leading to less DOM traffic.
- Worked on zoomType for stock charts, allowing the reset button to work more intuitively (#979)
