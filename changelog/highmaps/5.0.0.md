- Most changes listed under Highcharts 5.0.0 above also apply to Highmaps 5.0.0.
- Simplified the map configuration by setting a general [chart.map](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.map) option and allowing tuples in the [data description](http://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series%3Cmap%3E.data).
- Added new option, [chart.mapTransforms](http://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/chart.mapTransforms).
