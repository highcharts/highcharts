# Changelog for Highcharts Stock v12.5.0 (2026-01-12)

- Most changes listed under Highcharts 12.5.0 above also apply to Highcharts Stock 12.5.0.
- Added `className` option in `navigation.bindings` to allow for CSS customizations of annotations, see [#2290](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/2290)2.
