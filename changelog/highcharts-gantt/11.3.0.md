# Changelog for Highcharts Gantt v11.3.0 (2024-01-10)

- Most changes listed under Highcharts 11.3.0 above also apply to Highcharts Gantt 11.3.0.
- Changed the default color of the Gantt axis grid, to a more lightweight presence. The associated options are [xAxis.grid.borderColor](https://api.highcharts.com/gantt/xAxis.grid.borderColor) and `yAxis.grid.borderColor`.
- Added width to data label in x-range and gantt series, allowing implementers to easily apply word-wrap or ellipsis within the tasks. See [#17148](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/17148).
- Added support for [grid.columns](https://api.highcharts.com/gantt/xAxis.grid.columns) on tree-grid axes.
