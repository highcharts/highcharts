            <p>Highcharts 5.0.3 (2016-11-18)</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Added new option,
                <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/lang.numericSymbolMagnitude">lang.numericSymbolMagnitude</a>, to support numeric symbol shortening in Japanese, Korean and certain Chinese locales.</li>

              <li>Added new CSS custom property, <code>textOutline</code>, and at the same time removed the <code>textShadow</code> shim. Closes

                <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.pinchType">chart.pinchType</a> option. Allow <code>pinchType</code> and <code>zoomType</code> to be set independently. When <code>tooltip.followTouchMove</code> is true, <code>pinchType</code> only applies to two-finger touches. Closes

              <li>Implemented bubbles in the Boost module.</li>
              <li>Improved alignment of ticks on multiple axes by allowing ticks to be placed at less strict intervals.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Included the Standalone Framework in Highcharts and removed the concept of adapters.</li>
              <li>Removed global properties in Highcharts and modules. Closes
                <a href="https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/4389">#4389</a>.</li>
              <li>Added new constructor, <code>Highcharts.chart</code>, that allows instanciating a chart without the <code>new</code> keyword.</li>
              <li>Added an option to set the <code>renderTo</code> div as the first argument to the constructor, like <code>Highcharts.chart(renderTo, options);</code>.</li>
              <li>Added support for <code>fill-opacity</code> and <code>stroke-opacity</code> attributes on VML renderer. Support semi-transparent fill with named colors on area series.</li>
              <li>Breaking change: Easing functions from jQuery UI no longer work. They will fall back to the default &quot;swing&quot; easing. With Highcharts 4.2, the easing function must be defined on the Math object itself.</li>
              <li>Breaking change: The sparkline demo has some changes in the constructor.</li>

              <li>The default design has been updated with Highcharts 4, but all aspects of design can be reverted to the Highcharts 3 looks by applying options. See
                <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/highcharts/Y5ak7/">this design compatibilty demo</a> for a listing of what options it applies to.</li>

              <li>Added new option,

When it is false, dragging a single finger is ignored by the chart, and causes the whole page
                to scroll. This applies only when zooming is not enabled.

                        depending on where your legend is positioned. To prevent this, set a new option, floating to true in your legend options. Furthermore, the x and y values of the legend position is now relative to the chart.spacingTop and chart.spacingLeft
                        etc. properties instead of the chart&#39;s outer edge.</li>
