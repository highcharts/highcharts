                      <li>Legend positioning: Since version 2.1 Highcharts is aware of the size of the titles and legend and will try to make room for these in the chart&#39;s margins. When upgrading from older versions, this may lead to too great margins depending on where your legend is positioned. To prevent this, set a new option, floating to true in your legend options. Furthermore, the x and y values of the legend position is now relative to the chart.spacingTop and chart.spacingLeft etc. properties instead of the chart&#39;s outer edge.</li>

After discussion among our users, there seems to be a consensus that an up day is a day where the close value is higher than the open value. As opposed to a day where the close value is higher than the previous trade day&#39;s close value. The functionality is now reverted to what it was before.
