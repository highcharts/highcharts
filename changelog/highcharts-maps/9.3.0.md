# Changelog for Highcharts Maps v9.3.0 (2021-10-21)

- Most changes listed under Highcharts 9.3.0 above also apply to Highcharts Maps 9.3.0.
- Improved map geometry by removing axes and implementing a [MapView class](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts.MapView). The `MapView` includes, currently as a beta feature, client side projection. Part of the improved geometry is the new [series.data.geometry](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.mappoint.geometry) option to make it easier working with GeoJSON.

## Upgrade notes
- Programmatically zooming the map by running `Axis.setExtremes()` no longer works. Instead, use [MapView.setView](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts.MapView#setView).

## Bug fixes
- Fixed [#15656](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues/15656), resolved broken mouse scroll on some browsers.
