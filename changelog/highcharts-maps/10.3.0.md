# Changelog for Highcharts Maps v10.3.0 (2022-10-31)

- Most changes listed under Highcharts 10.3.0 above also apply to Highcharts Maps 10.3.0.
- Better default value for `legend.valueDecimals` for color axis with data classes. Now it preserves the decimals of the `from` and `to` settings by default.
- Improved the UX on legend items when using a color axis with data classes. Hovering now renders other map areas as inactive, and clicking the legend item renders them as `null` rather than completely hiding them.
