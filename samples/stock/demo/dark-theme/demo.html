    <p class="highcharts-description">A dark-themed stock demo focused on ease
        of use and readability. The dropdown range selector allows for quick
        timeframe adjustments, enhancing the chart's analytical utility. In the
        navigator, a candlestick series mirrors the main chart, providing a
        consistent and detailed navigation tool. The tooltip is minimalistic,
        displaying only crucial information to avoid clutter. This setup aims to
        offer a straightforward and efficient approach to stock data analysis.
