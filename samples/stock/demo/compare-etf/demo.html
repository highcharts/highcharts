        Compare the performance of a chosen index and a buffer ETF thanks to
        Highcharts' built-in series compare option, which handles all of the
        calculations under the hood. Adjust the PERIOD_CAP and PERIOD_BUFFER
        parameters in the demo, to see how plot lines and plot bands get adjusted
        automatically at the same time.
