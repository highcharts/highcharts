            Relative Rotation Graphs®️ visualize the relation between the
            strength and momentum of various assets against a chosen benchmark
            (i.e. S&P 500 index) and themselves. The performance is visualized
            in four quadrants. Leading (green) - the asset is stronger than the
            benchmark and it's getting stronger (positive momentum), Weakening
            (yellow) - the asset is stronger than the benchmark, but it's
            getting weaker (negative momentum), Lagging (red) - the asset is
            weaker than the benchmark and it's getting weaker, Improving (blue)
            - the asset is weaker than the benchmark, but it's getting stronger.
