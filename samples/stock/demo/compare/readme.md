#Compare multiple series
This demo fetches and visualizes the stock prices of MSFT (Microsoft Corporation), GOOG (Google) and AAPL (Apple). All the series start at the same point, then changes in percentage are plotted on the same Y axis regardless of the actual data values.


#### Tip
Since the data series are fetched asynchronously, they need to be sorted before the rendering process.
