        This demo showcases a Highcharts plugin that enhances chart
        interactivity by enabling zoom functionality along the y-axis. Combined
        with Morningstar data and MACD indicator, the chart can be used to
        analyze the AMD stock chart across 2021-2022 period.

        The plugin is a copy-paste ready solution that can be used with other
        charts as well.
