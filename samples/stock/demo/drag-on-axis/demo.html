        This demo showcases a Highcharts plugin that enhances chart
        interactivity by enabling zoom functionality along the yAxis. Combined
        with Morningstar data and MACD indicator, the chart can be used to
        analyze the AMD stock chart across 2021-2022 period.

        The plugin is a copy-paste ready solution that can be used with other
        charts as well.
