This is a complex audio chart demo, demonstrating different techniques for sonifying data. Choose between focusing on temperature, humidity, wind speed, or pressure. Precipitation and visibility data can be turned on and off individually. Precipitation is sonified as chords increasing in intensity as the rainfall increases. Visibility is sonified as noise increasing in intensity as visibility is reduced, illustrating fog. Click on points to sonify that particular area of the chart.
