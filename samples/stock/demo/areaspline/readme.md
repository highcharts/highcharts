#Area spline
[Area spline](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/series.areaspline) is a variant of the area chart with smooth curves. 

#### Tip
Set the type to [areaspline](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/series.areaspline) under the series to get the areaspline chart.
Notice the use of the [fillColor](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/series.areaspline.fillColor) feature to get the linear gradient effect.
