        Point and figure series are used in technical analysis to represent
        changes in stock prices over time, focusing solely on price movements
        without time and volume. The columns of X's represent a rising price,
        while O's - falling prices. Each symbol corresponds to a specific price
        movement, and the new marker is created only when the price changes by a
        predetermined amount, known as the box size. A new column is created
        only if the price goes in the opposite direction, and the threshold
        required to create one is called the reversal amount.

        <p>This series requires an OHLC format data and all of the calculations
        are done under the hood. As this is a PoC, only close values are used
        for calculation - there is no support for High/Low values yet.</p>

        <p>Users can specify the following options:</p>

        <p><code>boxSize: number | string | undefined</code> - by default, this
        option is set to <code>'1%'</code>, user can choose between any positive
        number or a percentage value in string.</p>

        <p><code>reversalAmount: number | undefined</code> - by default, this
            option is set to <code>1</code>, user can only set it to other
            positive number.</p>

        <p><code>maxPointWidth: number | undefined</code> - by default, this
        option is set to undefined, which defaults to two times the marker
        height.</p>
