    <p class="highcharts-description">A minimalistic, black and white stock
    demo, focused on readability and usability. The buttons above the chart
    allow changing the current timeframe of each candle to the chosen period,
    while the navigator located at the bottom highlights the current data range.
    This provides a quick overview of the data, and allows us to fine-tune the
    desired range. For this particular example, the tooltip is fixed at the top
    left corner of the chart, with asset name and OHLC values shown
    respectively. To avoid date confusion, the first x-axis tick label will
    always show the day, month, and year of the current range, while the rest of
    them are designed to show the current day, month, and time.</p>
