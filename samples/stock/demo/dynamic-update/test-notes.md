1. Verify that the update runs with smooth animation. Navigator window should stick
to the right.

2. Move navigator window a bit to the left and verify that that it now sticks to
data, so the main series doesn't change.

3. Move the navigator window all the way to the left and verify that it sticks
to the left edge, and that the main data series animates again.
