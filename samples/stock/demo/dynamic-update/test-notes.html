Verify that the update runs with smooth animation. Navigator window should stick
to the right. Move navigator window a bit to the left and verify that that it
now sticks to data, so the main series doesn't change. Move the navigator window
all the way to the left and verify that it sticks to the left edge, and that the
main data series animates again.
