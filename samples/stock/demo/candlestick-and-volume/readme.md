#Two panes, candlestick and volume
The candlestick visualizes the price movements of a security, derivative or currency, and the volume chart visualizes the number of shares traded. 
The following demo displays price and volume by combining a [candlestick](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/plotOptions.candlestick) and a [volume](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/plotOptions.column) chart. The demo is divided into two panes, with a resizer handle between the panes.

#### Tip
Notice that every single candlestick has four variables: Low, Close, Open and High.
