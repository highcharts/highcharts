        An order book chart is a chart visualization representing real-time bids
        and asks for a specific asset in a trading environment. This Highcharts
        demo showcases a dynamic order book chart, enabling users to visualize
        the depth of the market for any given asset. The chart is structured to
        display two main components: buy orders (bids) and sell orders (asks),
        each plotted on either side of a central price line, illustrating market
        depth and price levels at which trades can potentially occur.
