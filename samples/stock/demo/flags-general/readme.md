# Flags marking events
Flags are useful when you want to include further details about specific events along a chart’s timeline. This chart uses six flags with specific information on particular data such as the stocks fall in Greece, the Zimbabwe decision to replace the USD, etc.
#### Tip
To add a [flag](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/plotOptions.flags), set a new series flag type under series with a date, a title and a short text.
