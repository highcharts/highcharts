# Disabled navigator
The [navigator](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/navigator), like the scrollbar, if not critical, could distract your audience from the main chartâ€™s message. 
#### Tip
Set the [enabled](https://api.highcharts.com/highstock/navigator.enabled) feature in the navigator to false to disable the scrollbar.
