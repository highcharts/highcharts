            This demo demonstrates "scrubbing", where the user can drag a slider to sonify the part of the chart where the slider is located. This allows for more control on the speed of the sonification, as well as exploring back and forth.

        <p>
            The concept can be extended to pure mouse/touch movements as well, and does not have to be linked to a slider. For example, the same concept can be used to sonify as the user is moving the mouse over the chart.
