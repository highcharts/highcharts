        This chart shows an extra lightweight and customizable way of working, where only the Synth capabilities of the sonification module are leveraged. The sonification logic is custom, and handled manually. This allows for bespoke implementations, either for performance reasons, or to achieve sonifications beyond what is possible with the built-in features.
