            By default, pitch is mapped within each Y-axis. Here, with pitch mapped within Y-axis, the first series will get its own pitch mapping, while Series 2 and Series 3 will be mapped onto the same pitch range relative to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the pitch range goes from the notes C2 to C5, Series 1 will be mapped with its lowest value to C2, and its highest to C5 - taking up the whole pitch range. For the other series, C2 will be mapped to whichever value is lowest among Series 2 and Series 3, and C5 will be mapped to whichever value is highest within both series, so that both series share the same pitch range.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any mapping parameter, not just pitch, can be mapped within the chart, an axis, or the series.
