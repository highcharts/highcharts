        The following chart is demonstrating a very simple configuration with the Accessibility-module included. 
        It is showing that if you include the module, you still need to give some options for the demo to give the demo context for screen reader users.
        The demo is missing title for the axes, names for the series and value suffix for the data points.
        Highcharts will by default make the text available to a screen reader when these options are set, without the need of adding options to the Accessibility-module.
