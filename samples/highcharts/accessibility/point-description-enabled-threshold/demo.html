    <p class="highcharts-description">The following chart demonstrates some Accessibility features of Highcharts, including use of the <code>pointDescriptionEnabledThreshold</code> option.
    The <code>pointDescriptionEnabledThreshold</code> is set to 1 in this demo, which means the individual points are are not exposed to a screen reader if a series contains more than one point.
    This is useful for larger series and is set by default to 200.</p>
