# Tree map with color axis
[Treemap](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.treemap) is the perfect chart to visualize [hierarchy](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/hierarchy.html) and [comparison](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/comparison.html), as it gives a quick and high-level view of the data set. Treemap uses mainly a color and value to visualize each element; the value is used to show the size of the element, and the color shows the category or the importance of the element.

####  Tip
Add the [Highcharts treemap module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treemap) to render the heat map, and the [Highcharts heatmap module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/heatmap) to visualize colors.
