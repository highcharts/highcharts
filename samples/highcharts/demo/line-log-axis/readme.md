# Logarithmic axis
The Logarithmic axis is very effective to visualize, on the same scale, a data set with extreme value gaps such as this demo with a data set from 0.1 to 1000. 
####  Tip
Use the [type](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.type) feature, under the yAxis, with the logarithmic value to create the logarithmic chart.
Notice the logarithmic horizontal lines to alert the users and avoid any confusion with a regular scale chart.
