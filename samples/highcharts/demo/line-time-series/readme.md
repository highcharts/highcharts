#Time series, zoomable
The zooming capability is a powerful feature that allows users to interact and explore the chart at will; The zooming capability is highly recommended when a large data set is used to find and track [trends](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/trend.html).

#### Tip
Enable the zooming capability by using the zoomType option.
Notice the appearance of the [reset zoom button](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.resetZoomButton) after the zooming capability is activated.
