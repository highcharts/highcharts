        Chart demonstrating more advanced accessibility configuration, using
        a custom series type based on the boxplot series.
        The chart is depicting fictional fruit consumption data, with the
        minimum, maximum and median values for each month of 2019. Most plums
        were eaten in spring, and none at all in July or August. Bananas and
        apples were both consumed in smaller numbers and steadily throughout
        the year.
