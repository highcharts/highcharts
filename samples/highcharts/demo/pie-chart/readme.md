# Pie chart
The [pie chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.pie) is an excellent chart to visualize a quick overview of a [composition](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/composition.html) or a [comparison](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/comparison.html).

####  Tip
Users can get confused quickly if a high number of data sets is used.
Notice the use of the feature [sliced](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series%3Cpie%3E.data.sliced) to detach the slice from the center.
