        Spline charts are smoothed line charts, and this example
        shows an inverted spline chart. Inverting the chart means the
        X-axis is positioned as the vertical axis, and the Y-axis is
        positioned as the horizontal axis. This can be more intuitive
        for certain data sets, such as in this chart where the X-axis
        represents vertical altitude.
