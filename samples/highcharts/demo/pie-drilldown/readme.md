# Pie with drilldown
The drilldown capability is a powerful feature that allows users to explore hierarchical data by interacting with the chart. On drilling down, each slice is smoothly animated into a new pie series to highlight to the user how the data is connected.

####  Tip
The most efficient way to add data to a chart is by using the [Highcharts data module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/working-with-data/data-module), as all the heavy and time-consuming parsing process is taking care of by the data module.
