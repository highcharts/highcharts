# Parallel coordinates
[Parallel coordinates](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/parallel-coordinates-chart) are often used to visualize multidimensional numerical datasets. In this demo, seven variables are gathered all together on one chart to show the marathon set; each variable has it own y axis. 

####  Tip
Use the following module ***/modules/parallelcoordinates.js*** to create the parallel coordinates.
Avoid using many categories as it could confuse the users.
