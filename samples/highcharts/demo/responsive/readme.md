# Responsive chart
A responsive chart is no longer a revolution; it has become a standard, and this demo includes specific options for responsive breakpoints. The chart’s elements change according to the width.

####  Tip
Notice the legend’s positions based on the available space. For a small width, the Y axis labels decrease to enhance visibility, and the subtitle is hidden to give more room to the title.
Use the feature [responsive](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/responsive) to achieve a customized responsive chart.
