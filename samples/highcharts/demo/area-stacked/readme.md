# Stacked area
A stacked area chart is used to increase the visibility of the area chart by stacking the data sets on each other, as the quantitative data or the data volume of each series are no longer hiding. The stacked area often are used to visualize [trends](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/trend.html) and [comparisons](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/trend.html). 

####  Tip
Notice the use of the [stacking](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.stacking) feature with the value ***normal*** to enable the stacked area.
