# Polar chart
The [polar chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.polar) is often used to compare data set with many quantitative or qualitative variables. A polar chart in Highcharts is simply a cartesian chart where the X axis is wrapped around the perimeter, and it can render common cartesian series types like line, column, area or arearange.

####  Tip
Set the [startAngle](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/pane.startAngle) to 0 and the [endAngle](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/pane.endAngle) to 360 to get the circular shape.
