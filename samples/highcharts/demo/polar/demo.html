        A polar chart showing different series types on a radial axis. Polar
        charts, also known as a radar charts, are often used to compare
        multivariate data sets. A polar chart in Highcharts is simply a
        cartesian chart where the X axis is wrapped around the perimeter. It
        can render common cartesian series types like line, column, area or
        arearange.
