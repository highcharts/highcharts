# Play chart as sound
This demo visualizes a data set using sound. Use the buttons below the chart to control playback.
In this chart, the temperature is mapped to frequency, so higher temperatures correspond to higher pitch.
San Diego temperatures are played panned to the left, while New York is panned to the right.
Notice how the two series get closer to each other as the year progresses towards summer.
At the plot line, a special sound will play to indicate a point of interest.

####  Tip
- Try clicking a point to play the points at that x-value.
- Hiding a series by clicking the legend items will mute that series.
