# Columns, line, and pie
Combine multiple charts series on one chart is very powerful visualization, as each series type brings its benefits to a better understanding and clarity. In this demo, the pie chart offers a global [comparison](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/comparison.html) overview, and the column chart visualizes a detailed comparison. The line chart shows the average [trend](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/trend.html) over time.

####  Tip
Keep in mind to create simple charts and to avoid using an overwhelming number of charts types.
