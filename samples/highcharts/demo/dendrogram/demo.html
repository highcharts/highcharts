        A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that visualizes the results of a hierarchical clustering analysis, showing the relationships and similarity levels among a group of entities. Objects are merged into branches (clusters) based on their similarities, with the height of the branches indicating the level of similarity or distance at which those clusters were formed.
