        Pie chart demonstrating a monochrome color scheme. Monochrome color
        schemes can make certain charts easier to understand, as it helps
        readers to focus on the content instead of the colors. There can also
        be accessibility benefits to using this kind of color scheme, both fo
        color blindness and tactile mediums, as long as there is a clear
        separation between slices.
