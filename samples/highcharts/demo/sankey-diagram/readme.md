# Sankey diagram 
[Sankey diagram](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.sankey) visualizes the flow motion and its volume between different nodes, such as the flow of energy and its volume between the producers and consumers.

####  Tip
Use the module sankey.js to create a Sankey diagram.
Notice the structure of the [keys](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.sankey.keys) feature that links the nodes using the keyword from and to, and weight to represent the volume of the flow: keys: ['from', 'to', 'weight'].
