# Spiderweb
A spiderweb chart or radar chart is a variant of the polar chart. Spiderweb chart is also used to compare data set using multiple variables, like the following demo using six variable of [comparison](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/comparison.html).

####  Tip
Set [tickmarkPlacement](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.tickmarkPlacement) to on to position the variables on the axes, and set [lineWidth](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.lineWidth) to 0 to get rid of the arcs between the categories. To get the hexagonal shape set [gridLineInterpolation](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.gridLineInterpolation) to ***polygon***.
