# Large tree map
A treemap with the drilling capability is a powerful chart to visualize [comparison](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/comparison.html) and [hierarchy](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/hierarchy.html). The first level of this demo allows the users to get a quick overview of the global mortality rate comparison in 2012 between the continent, where the drill down focus on the hierarchy aspect of the chart.

####  Tip
Set the feature [allowDrillToNode](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.treemap.allowDrillToNode) to true to enable the drill down capability.
