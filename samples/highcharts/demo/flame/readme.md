# Flame chart

A flame chart could be found when profiling performance using a web browser developer tools. There are three main layouts.

### 1) Flame

The main tasks are on the bottom of the chart and details are stacked on top.

### 2) Icicle

It is similar to the flame layout but yAxis is reversed, so the main tasks are on the top and details go down.

### 3) Sunburst

The main tasks are closer to the center of the chart and details are stacked as more outer rings.
