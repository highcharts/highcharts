# Line chart with custom HTML demo
This demo showcases how to build a custom HTML legend outside of the chart container and implement a custom tooltip, rather than relying on the built-in legend and tooltip systems.

**Note:** The legend is not included in exports.

#### Tip
Use the [chart events](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.events) to dynamically generate HTML content based on the series data. This approach allows full control over the layout and design of the legend.

You can style the legend with HTML/CSS and enhance it further by adding sparklines, trend icons etc.
