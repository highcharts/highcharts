# VU meter
With the right settings and a good imagination, the gauge chart can simulate any instrument with a needle and an arc shape, such a VU meter in this demo.

####  Tip
To mimic the VU meter set the red band using the [innerRadius](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/pane.background.innerRadius) and [outerRadius](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/pane.background.outerRadius) features in a [plotBands](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.plotBands) option. The back ground color is set using the [plotBackgroundColor](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.plotBackgroundColor) option.
Use the [pane](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/pane) feature to set up the arc shape and color.
