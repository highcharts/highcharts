# Box plot
The [BoxPlot](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.boxplot) (also known as a box and whisker plot) helps users to visualize five different data of the same elements; the median, the upper quartiles, the lower quartiles, the minimum data values, and the maximum data values.

####  Tip
Use the [plotLines](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.plotLines) to visualize the mean (the average value).
