# Pie with legend
In this chart the data labels are disabled and the legend is enabled. It is recommended to go with the default option and keep the data labels, as it is easier to read a chart where the labels are next to the shapes. This option provides a cleaner, visual appearance.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the feature [dataLabels](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.pie.dataLabels.enabled) to enable or disable the labels.
