# Column range
[Column range](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.columnrange) is the right chart to compare the range of each element between a low and high value.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the inverted option to draw the X axis vertically.
Adapt the x axis to the right if the audience read from right to left, for instance, an audience from the Middle East.
