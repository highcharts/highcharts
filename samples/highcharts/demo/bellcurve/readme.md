# Bell curve
[Bell curve](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.bellcurve) is used to visualize normal distribution, where the top of the bell represents the most probable event in a series of data.
The following demo renders a bell curve chart and a scatter chart using the same data.
#### Tip
For better clarity when displaying two different chart types, use the [xAxis](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.bellcurve.xAxis) and [yAxis](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.bellcurve.yAxis) options to set up different axes.
