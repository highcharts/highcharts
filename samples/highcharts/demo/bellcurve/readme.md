# Bell curve
[Bell curve](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.bellcurve) is used to visualize normal distribution. Assuming the underlying data is normally distributed, the 'area' of a zone represents the likelyhood of a datapoint falling inside it. The likelyhood is highest near the mean, and gets lower further out.
The following demo renders a bell curve chart and a scatter chart using the same data.
