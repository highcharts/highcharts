# Pyramid chart
The [pyramid chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.pyramid) is often used to visualize a [hierarchical](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/hierarchy.html) structure that has a progressive order, such as a sales progress.

####  Tip
Add the [Highcharts funnel module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/funnel-series) to render the pyramid chart, but set the ***type*** to ***pyramid*** in the ***chart*** option.
To center the pyramid and the labels, use the [center](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.pyramid.center) feature under plotOptions.
