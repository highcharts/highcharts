# Waterfall
The [waterfall chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.waterfall) is best to visualize the cumulative values contribution; the values are represented by segments or columns. In other words, a waterfall chart is a chain of segments where the end of a segment is the point of reference to the next segment.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the [upColor](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.waterfall.upColor) feature for the positive values and [color](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.waterfall.color) feature for the negative values.
