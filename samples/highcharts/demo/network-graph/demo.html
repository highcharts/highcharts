        This force directed graph shows an example of a network graph, where
        the nodes represent languages and the language families they belong to.
        The nodes can be dragged around and will be repositioned dynamically.
        Network graphs are typically used to show relations in data. In this
        case, we are showing a hierarchical structure.
