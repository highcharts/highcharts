# Parallel coordinates polar chart
[Parallel coordinates](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/parallel-coordinates-chart) are often used to visualize multidimensional numerical datasets. In this demo, five key properties of selected elements from the periodic table are displayed on one chart. Each property has its own radial axis, showcasing trends and variations across different elemental groups and states.

####  Tip
Use the following module ***/modules/parallel-coordinates.js*** to create the parallel coordinates.
Use ***/highcharts-more.js*** to create the polar chart.
Avoid using many categories as it could confuse the users.
