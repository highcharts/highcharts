# Column with negative values
Negative values on a column chart help users to visualize elements that are located under a specific reference, in this demo the value zero. 

####  Tip
Use the [threshold](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series%3Ccolumn%3E.threshold) option to change the value of the reference.
Notice that there are no special features required to create the negative effect, as it is processed by default.
