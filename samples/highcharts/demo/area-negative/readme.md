# Area with negative values
Negative values on an area chart help users to visualize the quantity of data or volume that are located under a specific reference. In this demo, the value of the reference is zero. 

####  Tip
Use the [threshold](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series%3Carea%3E.threshold) option to change the value of the reference.
Notice that no special features are required to create the negative effect; it is processed by default.
