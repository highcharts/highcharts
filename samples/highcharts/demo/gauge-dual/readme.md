# Gauge with dual axes
Axes can also be featured on a gauge chart, like in this demo, where the needle points to two different values at the same time. 

####  Tip
Keep in mind to always add useful information such as the display of the labels at the center of the chart to show the numbers pointed by the needle.
Use the [pane](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/pane) feature to set up the arc shape and color.
