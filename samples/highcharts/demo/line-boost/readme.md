# Line chart with 500k points
Rendering a huge number of points in a split of a second is a crucial criterion for many industries such as the financial and research industries. The demo visualizes 500k points with ease thanks to the Highcharts [Boost module](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/news/175-highcharts-performance-boost/).
####  Tip
Just add the Highcharts boost module (***module/boost.js***) to your Highcharts charts to improve the rendering performance without any configuration or extra code.
