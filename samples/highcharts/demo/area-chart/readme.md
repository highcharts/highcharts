Area charts are commonly used to visualize volumes, either as stacked or threshold-based. This demo compares the nuclear stockpiles volume over time between USA and USSR/Russia.
 
####  Tip
Notice the use of the [pointStart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.pointStart) feature to avoid having to set an X value for each point.
