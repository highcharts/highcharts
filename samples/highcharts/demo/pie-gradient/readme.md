# Pie with gradient fill
Gradient fill is a good feature to provide depth and texture to design. All color options in Highcharts can be defined as a gradient, including chart background, column fills, etc.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the option [linearGradient](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/colors) option to set up the gradient effect.
