# Percentage area

Percentage area is a variant of the stacked area, where each element of a data set is compared in percentage with the next data set element.

#### Tip

Notice the use of the [stacking](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.stacking) feature with the value **_percent_** to enable the percentage stacked area.
