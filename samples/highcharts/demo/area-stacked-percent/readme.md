# Percentage area
Percentage area is a variant of the stacked area, where each element of a data set is compared in percentage with the next data set element.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the [stacking](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.stacking) feature with the value ***percent*** to enable the percentage stacked area.
