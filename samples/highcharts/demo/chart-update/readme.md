# Update options after render
All options can be changed at run-time using the [chart.update](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Chart.update) function. This demo shows the capability to switch the chart type by clicking on three different buttons to select between polar, column, and bar chart.

####  Tip
The [update](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Chart.update) can also be used to change the series type or any other option.
