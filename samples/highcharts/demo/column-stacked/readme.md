# Stacked column
A stacked bar chart is an excellent choice to compare categories. By stacking series on each other, the users focus more on each column at the time, and the chart is easily readable.
Stacked column chart also helps to show data that accumulated into a sum. From Wikipedia: “The stacked bar chart stacks bars that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups”.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the option [stackLabels](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.stackLabels) to visualize the total value on each column.
