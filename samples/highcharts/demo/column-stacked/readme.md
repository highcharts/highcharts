# Stacked column
A stacked bar chart is an excellent choice to compare categories. By stacking series on each other, the users focus more on each column at the time, and the chart is easily readable.
Stacked column chart also helps to show data that accumulated into a sum. A stacked bar chart layers bars representing different groups vertically, with the total bar height reflecting the combined values of those groups.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the option [stackLabels](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.stackLabels) to visualize the total value on each column.
