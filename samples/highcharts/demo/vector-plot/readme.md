# Vector plot
[Vector plot](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.vector) visualizes vectors using four values, the x and y coordinates, the length and the angle. The vector could represent the wind motions in an area, an electromagnetic field, etc.

####  Tip
Use the module /module/vector.js to use the vector plot.
Highlight a specific vector by changing its color: {x:5, y:5, length:300, direction:18, color: '# ff0000'}, check the complete demo [here](http://jsfiddle.net/highcharts/4427op90/).
