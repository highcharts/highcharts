# Area with missing points

Highcharts treat `null` values as missing data, and in an area chart this is
represented by a gap in the graph and the area.

#### Tip

Change the opacity of the area by setting the feature [fillOpacity](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.fillOpacity) under plotOptions.
