# Area with missing points
A good tip to set a chart with missing data is by using the value ***null***. Keep in mind that a missing data doesnâ€™t mean zero as a value.

####  Tip
Use the legend feature to personalize the legend.
Change the opacity of the area by setting the feature [fillOpacity](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.fillOpacity) under plotOptions.
