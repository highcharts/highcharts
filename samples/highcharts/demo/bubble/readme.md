# Bubble chart
[Bubble chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.bubble), like the scatter chart, is also used to visualize the relationship between elements but, instead of using only three variables, the bubble chart uses up to four different variables such as x coordinate, y coordinates, size, and color.

####  Tip
Use x, y and z coordinates in the data array as following ***data:[[x,y,z]]***, where the variable z represents the size of the bubble.
