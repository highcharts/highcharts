# Heat map and Bubble combination
The [heat map](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.heatmap) is great for visualising the prefrence of the different data types, while the [bubble series](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.bubble) represents the amount of data points belonging to the different categories. This makes it very easy to spot trends in preferred and not preferred outcomes.

####  Tip
Use the following data format ***Data:[x,y,value]*** for the heat map, where the value is represented by the color of the categories. Use the same data format ***Data:[x,y,value]*** for the bubbles, where the value is the amount of data points belonging to the specific categories.
