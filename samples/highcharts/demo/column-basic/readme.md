# Basic column

A [column chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column), like the bar chart, is often used to visualize **comparisons** of data sets with discrete data, where the focus is on the values instead of categories as people read from left to right. This demo visualizes comparisons of the monthly average rainfall of four cities.

The code of this demo is very simple to set, like the bar chart, as many features are already set by default such as the responsiveness,  tooltip, colors, legends, etc.

#### Tip
Adapt the x axis to the right if the audience read from right to left, for instance, an audience from the middle east.
