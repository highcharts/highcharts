# Multiple axes 
Multiple axes allow the visualization of multiple and completely different data set on the same chart. 
Avoid visualization too much series type on the same chart, and use different shapes and colors for each data set to help the general users and the color blind community to better explore the chart.

####  Tip
Use the option [opposite](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.opposite) to set up axes in the opposite direction for more clarity.
