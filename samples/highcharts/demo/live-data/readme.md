# Live and remote data

Datasets (CSV or JSON formatted) can be fetched remotely. There is also an option
to automatically refresh remote sets, leading to auto-updating charts.

_Supported formats_

-   JSON (column ordered), through [data.columnsURL](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.columnsURL)
-   JSON (row ordered), through [data.rowsURL](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.rowsURL)
-   CSV, through [data.csvURL](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.csvURL)

Polling can be enabled/disabled using [data.enablePolling](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.enablePolling), and the
refresh rate can be set with [data.dataRefreshRate](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/data.dataRefreshRate).
