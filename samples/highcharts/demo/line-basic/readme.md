#Basic line
A [line chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.line) is often used to visualize [trends](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/trend.html). In this demo, the number of employees in the solar installation is in a constant progress since 2013, where the other sector’s employees number has been stable.

#### Tip
Creating a line chart with Highcharts library is a time-saving task, as many features are already set by default such as the [tooltip](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/tooltip), colors, responsiveness, [title](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/Chart.title)’s position, etc.
