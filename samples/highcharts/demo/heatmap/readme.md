# Heat map
The [heat map](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.heatmap) is the perfect chart to visualize [hot spots](https://smartvikisogn.github.io/HChartsCatalog/webpages/hotspots.html) within a large number of data, and to find pattern or correlation. The heat map uses colors and a compact design to visualize a huge data set to find patterns.

####  Tip
Use the following data format ***Data:[x,y,value]***, where value represents the density of the color to display on the chart.
