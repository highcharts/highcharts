# Arc Diagram
The [arc-diagram chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.arcdiagram) visualizes relations and their strength between the nodes in the data set.

####  Tip
Use the module arc-diagram.js to create an Arc diagram.
Notice the structure of the [keys](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.arcdiagram.keys) feature that links the nodes using the keyword from and to, and weight to represent the volume of the connection: keys: ['from', 'to', 'weight'].
