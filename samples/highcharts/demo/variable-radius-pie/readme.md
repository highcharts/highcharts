# Variable radius pie
[Variable radius pie](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.variablepie) is like the pie chart but using up to two variables instead of one.
In this demo, the data set is compared based on their area and population using a variable radius pie chart.

####  Tip
Use the module ***/module/variable-pie.js*** to create a variable radius pie chart.
Notice the use of the y and z variables, where y represents the arcâ€™s length and z represents the radius.
