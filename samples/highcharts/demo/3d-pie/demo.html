        Chart demonstrating the use of a 3D pie layout.
        The "Xiaomi" slice has been selected, and is offset from the pie.
        Click on slices to select and unselect them.
        Note that 3D pies, while decorative, can be hard to read, and the
        viewing angles can make slices close to the user appear larger than they
        are.
