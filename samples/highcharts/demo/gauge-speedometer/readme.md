# Angular gauge
A [gauge chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.gauge) is an excellent chart for dashboards to visualize performances within an area with min and max values. A gauge chart is easy to read and to understand by users, as it shows quick and straightforward indications.

####  Tip
Use the [pane]() feature to set up the arc shape and color. 
To customize the colors of each range use the [plotBands](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.plotLines) feature.
