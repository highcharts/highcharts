# Polygon series
The [polygon series](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.polygon) allows developers to set any non-standard chart, by setting a table of coordinates to shape the chart.

####  Tip
Add the [highcharts-more](https://www.highcharts.com/blog/news/47-ranges-polar-charts-and-gauges-released/) module to render the waterfall chart, and set the ***type*** to ***polygon***.
