# Scatter plot
[Scatter chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.scatter) is often used to visualize the relationship between elements using up to three different variables such as x coordinate,  y coordinates, and color.

####  Tip
Use x and y coordinates in the data array as following data:[[x,y]()]() .
Customize the points on the chart by using the [marker](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.scatter.marker.states.hover) option under plotOptions.
Notice the fixed legend thanks to the setting in the [legend](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/legend) option.
