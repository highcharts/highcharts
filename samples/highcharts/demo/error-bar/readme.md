# Error bar
The [error bar](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.errorbar) is mainly used to visualize the error or uncertainty in a measurement system.

####  Tip
Notice the use of the [opposite](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.opposite) feature to set the rainfall axis on the right side.
Set the chart type to ***errorbar*** to enable the Error bar chart.
