# With annotations
Annotations are frequently used by authors to tell a story with a chart. Areas of
interest are highlighted, helping users to quickly focus on meaningful points by reducing the time to analyze the entire chart. 

####  Tip
Add the [annotation module](https://code.highcharts.local/modules/annotations.js) to be able to add annotations to the chart.
