# With annotations
Annotation is a smart way to highlight relevant points on charts, such as the names of the main places on a Tour de France Stage in this demo. Annotation helps users to quickly focus on meaningful points by reducing the time to analyze the entire chart. 

####  Tip
Add the annotation module ( ***modules/annotations.js*** ) to be able to set annotations on the chart.
