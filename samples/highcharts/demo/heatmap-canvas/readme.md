The following demo uses 8,000 points to visualize the temperature over the year; the extreme temperatures are easily detected by the blue and red color. Notice how we can trace from the chart when the sun is up throughout the year.

####  Tip
Include the Boost module for rendering a huge number of data points using ***WebGL technology***.
