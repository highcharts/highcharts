        Streamgraphs are a type of stacked area charts where the
        areas are displaced around a central axis. It is often
        used for displaying compound volume across different
        categories or over time. This demo visualizes the number of
        medals earned in the Winter Olympic Games for each
        participating country since 1924, using a relative scale.
