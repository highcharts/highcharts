# Streamgraph
[Streamgraph](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.streamgraph) visualizes groups trends and comparisons over time using the quantitative/volume values.
The following demo visualizes the number of winter Olympic medal earned for each country since 1924, using a relative scale.

####  Tip
Add the streamgraph module (modules/streamgraph.js) to use the streamgraph chart.
To use the [percentage scale](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.streamgraph.stacking) set stacking to percent.
