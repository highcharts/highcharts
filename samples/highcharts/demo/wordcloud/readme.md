# Word cloud
Word cloud analyses and visualizes textâ€™s words; the size of any word on the chart is proportional to its the frequency of appearance in the text. Word cloud is often used to detect the main focus of an individual or a group by analyzing the text they wrote.

####  Tip
Use the module ***/module/wordcloud.js*** to create a Word cloud chart.
