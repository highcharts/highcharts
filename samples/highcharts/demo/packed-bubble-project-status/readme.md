# Packed bubble chart
[Packed bubble chart](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.packedbubble), like the scatter chart, is also used to visualize the relationship between elements. A packed bubble series is a two dimensional series type, where each point renders a value in X, Y position. Each point is drawn as a bubble where the bubbles don't overlap with each other and the radius of the bubble related to the value.

####  Tip
Use y value in the data array as following ***data:[y, y, y]***, where the variable z represents the size of the bubble.
