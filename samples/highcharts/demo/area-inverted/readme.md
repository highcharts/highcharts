# Inverted axes
Inverted axes chart can be used to highlight the x axis data instead of the y axis, as users tend to read from left to right. 

####  Tip

You can change the opacity of the area by setting the feature [fillOpacity](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.area.fillOpacity) under plotOptions.
Keep in mind, to change the x axis from left to right, in case of the users read from right to left.
