    DataCursor is used in this demo to synchronize the mouse highlight in three
    DataTable(s) and their corresponding HTML tables. This is organised in two
    groups with the middle table as part of both groups. It adds and removes the
    'highlight' class on HTML table cells and rows, so that different shades of
    blue appear.
    <br /><br />
    This feature is useful when you need to compare multiple tables side by side
    and easily see which cell corresponds to the same value across all tables.
