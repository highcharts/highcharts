This holiday season, the Highcharts team honors the talented men and women who
have worked hard to make technology accessible to visually impaired people. 

In our efforts to contribute in this regard, one modality we are experimenting
with is sonification. 

Our Hertz go out to all our customers this season. We hope you enjoy this
chart-topper.
