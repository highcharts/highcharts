# Histogram with column series
A [histogram](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.histogram) chart can also be created using a column chart if the data is already pre-aggregated.

####  Tip
Use the [pointPadding](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.pointPadding), [borderWidth](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.borderWidth), [groupPadding](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.groupPadding) settings to set up a histogram chart with a column plot.
