<p>Chrome: All four formats should be exported successfully and otherwise look like the chart (except smaller size). Particularly
check PDF export, as we are here testing data URI length limits and PDFs take up more space.</p>
<p>FF: Same as Chrome.</p>
<p>Safari: Same as Chrome, though might open results in new tab instead of downloading.</p>
<p>Edge: PDF export should fail, the others should work as in Chrome.</p>
<p>IE (10/11): Same as Edge.</p>
