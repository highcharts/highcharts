<p>Chrome: All four formats should be exported successfully with data labels and otherwise look like the chart (except smaller size).</p>
<p>FF: Same as Chrome.</p>
<p>Safari: Same as Chrome, though might open results in new tab instead of downloading.</p>
<p>Edge: PDF export should fail, the others should work as in Chrome.</p>
<p>IE (10/11): Same as Edge.</p>
<p>IE (9 and older): Always falls back (offline download not supported). Same for all demos.</p>
