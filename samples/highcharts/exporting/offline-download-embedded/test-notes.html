<p>PDF should fail on all browsers.</p>
<p>Chrome: SVG and PNG/JPEG should both work, and include the embedded images. Should also include data labels. Should otherwise look like chart, just smaller size.</p>
<p>FF: Same as Chrome.</p>
<p>Safari: Same as Chrome, though might open results in new tab instead of downloading.</p>
<p>Edge: Only SVG export should work, but result should be as in Chrome.</p>
<p>IE: Nothing should work. Fall back for all options.</p>
