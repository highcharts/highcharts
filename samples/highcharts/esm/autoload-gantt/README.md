# gantt dependency mapping test

This is a generated test that ensures that all series types have a mapping
in the DependencyMapping.ts file.

If you get an error that a series type is missing, ensure that the series type
has a corresponding entry in the DependencyMapping.ts file. If not, add it
there and run `gulp dependency-mapping` to update the file.
