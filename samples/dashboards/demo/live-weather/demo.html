    <h1>Live Weather Demo</h1>
    <p>The demo shows weather forecasts from the <a
            href="https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation" target="_blank">Norwegian
            Meteorological Institute</a> in five Dashboards components. The first data row shows the latest 
            observation, the rest the forecast for the upcoming 24 hours.
    </p>
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>Weather stations are selected by clicking on a map marker. Weather parameters (temperature, wind, precipitation) are selected by clicking on a KPI (gauge).</p>
    <h2>Dashboards components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Highcharts Maps</b> markers and tooltip show the selected parameter.</li>
        <li><b>Dashboards HTML</b> shows the selected station with locational information.</li>
        <li><b>Dashboards KPI</b> shows info from the selected station: current temperature, current wind speed
            and expected precipitation over the next 24 hours.</li>
        <li><b>Dashboards Datagrid</b> shows all the parameters of the selected station for the next 24 hours.</li>
        <li><b>Highcharts Chart (spline, column, area/windbarb)</b> shows the selected parameter of the selected station
            for the next 24 hours.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data set</h2>
    <p>The data shown in this demo are weather forecasts containing temperature, wind strength and precipitation for a
        selection of weather stations in North America.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The station is selected by clicking on the map.</li>
        <li>The weather parameter (e.g. wind) is selected by clicking on a gauge in the KPI component.</li>
        <li>All date/time indications are in US date/time format, localized per time zone.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Customizing the demo</h2>
    <p>The demo offers limited customization possibilities directly in the code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New weather stations can be added (and existing deleted).</li>
        <li>Alternative sets of weather stations can be used.</li>
        <li>The range of the data set is configurable. By default the sample start from the latest
            observation and 24 hours into the future. Note that the entire data set covers 19 days.</li>
    </ul>
