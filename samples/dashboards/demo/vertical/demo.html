        Understanding how the climate has changed over time can help us prepare for the future. By looking at the data
        from the last 100 years, we can see patterns, learn what’s driving these changes, and start thinking about how
        we can address them. Let’s break down the numbers, decade by decade, to better understand the impact climate
        change has had on our planet.

    <h2>Extreme Weather Events</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Extreme weather includes events like hurricanes, floods, droughts, and heatwaves. These events become more
            frequent and severe as the planet warms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>- 1920-1950:</b> In the early 20th century, extreme weather events were rare. The planet was relatively
            stable, and while there were occasional storms and floods, they were not as frequent or intense as today.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>- 1950-1980:</b> As global temperatures rose, extreme weather events began to occur more often. By the
            1970s, scientists were noticing an increase in the frequency and intensity of storms and heatwaves.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>- 1980-2019:</b> From the 1980s to the 2010s, extreme weather events became a regular occurrence.
            Hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and droughts intensified, causing billions of dollars in damages and
            affecting millions of lives worldwide. These events are one of the most visible consequences of climate
            change, and they are projected to worsen as the planet continues to warm.

    <h2>Global Average Temperature Increase (°C)</h2>
    <div class="section-container">
        <div id="section-text">
            <p>
                The global average temperature is a key indicator of climate change. This column shows how much the Earth's
                temperature has increased compared to pre-industrial levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>- 1920-1950:</b> For the first half of the century, temperature increases were relatively small.
                Industrial
                activity was growing, but it hadn’t yet reached the levels that would drastically impact the climate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>- 1950-1980:</b> After World War II, industries boomed, and fossil fuel use increased
                significantly. By the
                1970s, the global temperature had increased by 0.3°C. This may seem like a small number, but for the
                planet’s
                delicate balance, even slight temperature changes can cause big disruptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>- 1980-2019:</b> From the 1980s onward, the pace of temperature increase accelerated dramatically.
                By the
                2010s, the global temperature had increased by 0.8°C. This steady increase is directly linked to human
                activity,
                particularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.

    <h2>CO2 Concentration (ppm)</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            CO2, or carbon dioxide, is one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's
            atmosphere. This column shows the concentration of CO2 in parts per million (ppm).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>- 1920-1950:</b> CO2 levels hovered around 305-315 ppm during the early 20th century. While industrial
            activity was
            increasing, CO2 emissions were not yet significant enough to cause noticeable shifts in climate patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>- 1950-1980:</b> After the 1950s, CO2 levels started to climb, reaching 327 ppm by the 1970s. The
            post-war boom in
            industrialization and the widespread use of cars played a large role in this increase.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>- 1980-2019:</b> CO2 levels rose dramatically, reaching 400 ppm by the 2010s. The combination of
            fossil fuel use,
            deforestation, and industrial emissions led to this unprecedented rise, which is a major contributor to
            the warming of the planet.

        <div id="co2-chart"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Sea Level Rise (cm)</h2>
    <div class="section-container">
        <div class="chart" id="sea-chart"></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Sea levels rise for two main reasons: melting ice from glaciers and ice sheets, and the expansion of seawater as
                it warms (thermal expansion). This column shows how much sea levels have risen globally.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>- 1920-1950:</b> For the first half of the century, sea levels were relatively stable, with only a slight
                rise of 0.2 cm by the 1930s. The changes were minimal because the Earth’s temperature hadn’t risen
                significantly yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>- 1950-1980:</b> As temperatures started to rise, glaciers began to melt and oceans expanded. By the
                1970s, the sea level had risen by about 2 cm. Though small, this rise had started to impact coastal regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>- 1980-2019:</b> From the 1980s onwards, the pace of sea level rise accelerated dramatically. By the
                2010s, sea levels had risen by 8 cm compared to early 20th-century levels, leading to coastal flooding and
                erosion in many parts of the world.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The past 100 years show a clear and concerning trend: the Earth is warming, CO2 levels are rising, sea levels
            are climbing, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe. While these changes might seem
            gradual when viewed decade by decade, the acceleration in recent years highlights the urgency of addressing
            climate change.
