    The dashboard demonstrates some capabilities of the MathModifier. The
    last column in the table is calculated automatically by a defined
    columnFormula option with the formula term "B1*C1".
    In the table, you can edit values in columns B and C but cannot change the
    formula used to calculate the value in column D. To do so, please change the
    `columnFormula` in the dashboard config. 
    Note how the change in column B or C is reflected in column D and in the charts.
