* Test zooming both with mouse wheel and mousepad. In both cases the animation
  should feel smooth. Verify that the labels do not disconnect from the shapes.
* Click the `Run zoomBy` button. Verify that there is first a smooth animation,
  interrupted by a non-animated zoom. Verify that the labels are placed
  correctly.
