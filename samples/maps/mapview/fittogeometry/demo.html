        <p>When the map view is fitted to a <code>MultiPoint</code> geometry, it
        makes sure that those points are within the view. When fitted to a
        <code>Polygon</code> geometry, the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic">geodesic</a>
        between the points in the polygon is fitted within the view.</p>

        <p>The Brazil and Arabia buttons demonstrate how extract the geometries
        from the source map and fit to one shape or multiple shapes
        respectively.</p>
