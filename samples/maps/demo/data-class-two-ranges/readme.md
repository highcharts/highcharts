# Data classes and popup
In this US presidential election 2012 demo, the map chart visualizes the winner in each state, and the pie chart visualizes the votes distribution by candidate.
#### Tip
Use the data [classes option](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/colorAxis.dataClasses) to set up ranges and colors for the choropleth map.
Thanks to the [Highcharts data module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/working-with-data/data-module), charts can easily fetch data from sources such as Google Sheets.
