# Zoom to area by double click
The zooming capability is a powerful feature that allows users to interact and explore the map at will. The zooming capability is highly recommended when a large and detailed map is used such as this map of the world.
#### Tip
Enable the zooming capability by setting up the [enabled](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/mapNavigation.enabled) option to true in [mapNavigation](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/mapNavigation).
Check out the [mouse wheel zoom](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/mapNavigation.enableMouseWheelZoom) and the [touch zoom](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/mapNavigation.enableTouchZoom) options.
