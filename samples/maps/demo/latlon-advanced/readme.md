# Advanced lat/long
This demo visualizes a US map with the main citiesâ€™ coordinates and their demographic population for each state. The demographic population is displayed using a [mapbubble](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.mapbubble).
#### Tip
Add the [proj4JS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/proj4js) to handle the mathematics of the lat/long conversion.
