# GeoJSON with rivers and cities
Highmaps accepts [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) geometry primitives such as Point, LineString and Polygon. The following demo uses GeoJSON map of Australia featuring the provinces, the main cities, and rivers.
#### Tip
Use the [Highcharts.geojson function](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts# geojson) to extract map data from the GeoJSON.
