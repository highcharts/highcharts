# Tile map, circles
The circle map, like the [honeycomb](https://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo/honeycomb-usa), help users to focus on the data without being distracted by the different areasâ€™ size.
#### Tip
Set the shape of the areas by using the option [tileShape](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.tilemap.tileShape).
