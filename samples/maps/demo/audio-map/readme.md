# Audio map
This audio map can be interacted with by clicking the map regions. The demo illustrates one way to use the sonification module with maps. Repeated sounds play with varying speed to indicate the population density of a region. After a while, the name of the region is announced with speech. A notification sound plays when moving between regions.
