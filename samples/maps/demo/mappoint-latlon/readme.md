# Map point with lat/long
The Highmaps library supports latitude and longitude coordinates, and it integrates them easily on maps. The following demo unveils the latitude and longitude coordinates of select British cities, pulled from the  [Highmaps Map Collection](https://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/).
#### Tip
Add the [proj4JS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/proj4js) library to handle the mathematics of the lat/long conversion.
