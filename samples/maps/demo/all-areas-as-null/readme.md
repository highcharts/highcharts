# Highlighted areas
Like the [categorized areas demo](https://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo/category-map), this demo shows another easy way to group countries.
#### Tip
To group countries, add the same value to their data values, e.g., ['is', 1],['no', 1],['se', 1],
To set the color of your choice use the [color](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.map.color) option.
