# Fixed tooltip with HTML
By adding a tooltip in a fixed spot on the chart, you may separate descriptive information from the initial presentation, making it possible to not overload the map with too much information on initial load. 
#### Tip
Be sure to add compact information in the fixed tooltip to avoid overwhelming the users.
