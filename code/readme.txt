WHAT FILES TO USE
- The files for classic mode are available in the /code folder. In this mode, 
  styles are set as options in the chart configuration.
- The JavaScript files for styled mode are available under the /code/js/ folder.
  In these files, most presentational code is removed, so without styling it
  will draw an ugly black-and-white chart if anything.
- The default CSS file for styled mode is available as /code/css/highcharts.css.
  This CSS is in turn based on a SCSS file, highcharts.scss that can be found
  in the Highcharts GitHub repo.
