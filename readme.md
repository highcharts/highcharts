## Example Usage in Node/Browserify/Webpack
Please note that there are several ways to use Highcharts. For general installation instructions, see [the docs](http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

```
npm install highcharts
```

```js
// Load Highcharts
var Highcharts = require('highcharts');

// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.
// var Highcharts = require('highcharts/highstock');

// This is how a module is loaded. Pass in Highcharts as a parameter.
require('highcharts/modules/exporting')(Highcharts);

// Generate the chart
var chart = new Highcharts.Chart({
  chart: {
    renderTo: 'container'
  },
  // ... more options - see http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts
});
