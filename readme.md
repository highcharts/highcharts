## Load Highcharts as a CommonJS module
Highcharts is using an UMD module pattern, as a result it has support for CommonJS.
*The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see [Download and install Highcharts](#download-and-install-highcharts) for more details.*
```js
// Load Highcharts
var Highcharts = require('highcharts');
// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.
// var Highcharts = require('highcharts/highstock');

// Load the exporting module, and initialize it.
require('highcharts/modules/exporting')(Highcharts);

// Generate the chart
Highcharts.chart('container', {
  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts
});
```

## Load Highcharts as an ES6 module
Since Highcharts supports CommonJS, it can be loaded as an ES6 module with the use of transpilers. Two common transpilers are [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). These have different interpretations of a CommonJS module, which affects your syntax.
*The following examples presumes you are using npm to install Highcharts, see [Download and install Highcharts](#download-and-install-highcharts) for more details.*
### Babel
```js
import Highcharts from 'highcharts';
// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.
// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';

// Load the exporting module.
import Exporting from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';
// Initialize exporting module.
Exporting(Highcharts);

// Generate the chart
Highcharts.chart('container', {
  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts
});
```
### TypeScript
```js
import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
// Alternatively, this is how to load Highstock. Highmaps is similar.
// import Highcharts from 'highcharts/highstock';

// Load the exporting module.
import * as Exporting from 'highcharts/modules/exporting';
// Initialize exporting module.
Exporting(Highcharts);

// Generate the chart
Highcharts.chart('container', {
  // options - see https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts
});
```

## Build and debug
If you want to do modifications to Highcharts or fix issues, you may build your own files. Highcharts uses Gulp as the build system. After `npm install` in the root folder, run `gulp`, which will set up a watch task for the JavaScript and SCSS files. Now any changes in the files of the `/js` or `/css` folders will result in new files being built and saved in the `code` folder. Other tasks are also available, like `gulp lint`.

```
npm install
gulp
```
