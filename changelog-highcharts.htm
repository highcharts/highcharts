<p>Highcharts 4.2.7 (2016-09-21)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added new feature, <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis.angle">yAxis.angle</a>, allowing positioning the axis line and labels in polar chart Y axes. This makes it practical to use multiple axes in polar charts.</li>
    <li>Added option, <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/xAxis.nameToX">xAxis.nameToX</a>, allowing points to have the same name but different axis positions on an axis of type <code>category</code>.</li>
