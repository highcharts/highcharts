/**
 * Options for the Boost module. The Boost module allows certain series types
 * to be rendered by WebGL instead of the default SVG. This allows hundreds of
 * thousands of data points to be rendered in milliseconds. In addition to the
 * WebGL rendering it saves time by skipping processing and inspection of the
 * data wherever possible. This introduces some limitations to what features are
 * available in boost mode. See [the docs](
 * https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/boost-module) for
 * details.
 *
 * In addition to the global `boost` option, each series has a
 * [boostThreshold](#plotOptions.series.boostThreshold) that defines when the
 * boost should kick in.
 *
 * Requires the `modules/boost.js` module.
