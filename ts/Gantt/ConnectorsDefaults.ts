         *
         * The default algorithms are as follows:
         *
         * `straight`:      Draws a straight line between the connecting
         *                  points. Does not avoid other points when drawing.

         * `simpleConnect`: Finds a path between the points using right angles
         *                  only. Takes only starting/ending points into
         *                  account, and will not avoid other points.
         *
         * `fastAvoid`:     Finds a path between the points using right angles
         *                  only. Will attempt to avoid other points, but its
         *                  focus is performance over accuracy. Works well with
         *                  less dense datasets.
         *
         * Default value: `straight` is used as default for most series types,
         * while `simpleConnect` is used as default for Gantt series, to show
         * dependencies between points.
