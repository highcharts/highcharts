# Highcharts Dashboards

Highcharts Dashboards is a JavaScript library for interactive dashboards from the creators of the [Highcharts](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts) charting library.

With built-in data synchronization, ready-made components and completely customizable options, Highcharts Dashboards does all the heavy lifting out of the box, saving you valuable time on your dashboard projects.

Note that this library also includes [Highcharts DataGrid](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/datagrid/general), that can be used as a standalone component outside of Dashboards if needed.
