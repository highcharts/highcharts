 * Integration method.
 *

 *
 * Euler:
 *
 * Basic form: `x(n+1) = x(n) + v(n)`
 *
 * With Rengoild-Fruchterman we get:
 * `x(n+1) = x(n) + v(n) / length(v(n)) * min(v(n), temperature(n))`
 * where:
 * - `x(n+1)`: next position
 * - `x(n)`: current position
 * - `v(n)`: velocity (comes from net force)
 * - `temperature(n)`: current temperature
 *
 * Known issues:
 * Oscillations when force vector has the same magnitude but opposite
 * direction in the next step. Potentially solved by decreasing force by
 * `v * (1 / node.degree)`
 *
 * Note:
 * Actually `min(v(n), temperature(n))` replaces simulated annealing.
