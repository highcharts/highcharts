/**
 * Apply a jitter effect for the rendered markers. When plotting
 * discrete values, a little random noise may help telling the points
 * apart. The jitter setting applies a random displacement of up to `n`
 * axis units in either direction. So for example on a horizontal X
 * axis, setting the `jitter.x` to 0.24 will render the point in a
 * random position between 0.24 units to the left and 0.24 units to the
 * right of the true axis position. On a category axis, setting it to
 * 0.5 will fill up the bin and make the data appear continuous.
 *
 * When rendered on top of a box plot or a column series, a jitter value
 * of 0.24 will correspond to the underlying series' default
 * [groupPadding](
 * https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.groupPadding)
 * and [pointPadding](
 * https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.pointPadding)
 * settings.
 *
 * **Note:** With boost mode enabled, the jitter effect is not supported.

     * An array of data points for the series. For the `scatter` series
     * type, points can be given in the following ways:
     *
     * 1. An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will
     *  be
     *    interpreted as `y` options. The `x` values will be automatically
     *    calculated, either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from
     *    `pointStart` and `pointInterval` given in the series options. If the
     *  axis
     *    has categories, these will be used. Example:
     *    ```js
     *    data: [0, 5, 3, 5]
     *    ```
     *
     * 2. An array of arrays with 2 values. In this case, the values correspond
     *  to
     *    `x,y`. If the first value is a string, it is applied as the name of
     *  the
     *    point, and the `x` value is inferred.
     *    ```js
     *    data: [
     *        [0, 0],
     *        [1, 8],
     *        [2, 9]
     *    ]
     *    ```
     *
     * 3. An array of objects with named values. The following snippet shows
     *  only a
     *    few settings, see the complete options set below. If the total number
     *  of
     *    data points exceeds the series'
     *    [turboThreshold](#series.scatter.turboThreshold), this option is not
     *    available.
