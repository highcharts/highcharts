         * Integration method.
         *
         * In Euler integration, force were stored in a node, not changing it's
         * position. Now, in the integrator method, we apply changes.
         *
         * Euler:
         *
         * Basic form: `x(n+1) = x(n) + v(n)`
         *
         * With Rengoild-Fruchterman we get:
         * `x(n+1) = x(n) + v(n) / length(v(n)) * min(v(n), temperature(n))`
         * where:
         * - `x(n+1)`: next position
         * - `x(n)`: current position
         * - `v(n)`: velocity (comes from net force)
         * - `temperature(n)`: current temperature
         *
         * Known issues:
         * Oscillations when force vector has the same magnitude but opposite
         * direction in the next step. Potentially solved by decreasing force by
         * `v * (1 / node.degree)`
         *
         * Note:
         * Actually `min(v(n), temperature(n))` replaces simulated annealing.
