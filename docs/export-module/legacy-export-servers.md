Deprecated export servers
-------------------------

Previously we had two older varieties of servers to choose from; these export servers are no longer maintained. The documentation below serves for reference purposes only.

1.  The Java and PhantomJS-based server, which also supports server-side rendering of charts
2.  PHP and Batik-based

### 1. Export server based on Java and PhantomJS

This solution also includes a standalone solution for creating charts on the server, without a client involved. Highcharts is using this export server at export.highcharts.com, the default Highcharts export server. It's a server which is desgined with a large network load in mind. Requests to this server are concurrently handled by an serverpool.

It takes either SVG or Highcharts options (in javascript) as input and converts it to images (PNG, JPEG ), PDF or SVG.

#### 1.1. Prerequisites for installation

The java based Highcharts export-server has the following prerequisites:

*   install an java application server (for example: Apache Tomcat, Jboss, TC server, Resin)

_TIP: use Jetty (application server) during development, requires no installation_

*   install Java 1.8
*   install Maven 3
*   install PhantomJS 2.0 on the server, [see here](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads)
*   download the source for the export-server module from [Github](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-export-server/tree/master/java). This is a maven module. Save the _highcharts-export_ folder to a convenient place.

#### 1.2. Configuration

Edit the `app-convert.properties` file in `highcharts-export/highcharts-export-web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring` and change the properties if necessary. Read the comments in the property file, for deciding what you need to change.

You can for example change the location of the PhantomJS executable, the name of the convert script, timeouts and poolsize of how many PhantomJS processes you want to run.

#### 1.3. Copy Highcharts Javascript to the maven project

Highcharts JS is needed on the server for supporting server-side rendering of charts. Instead of posting a SVG from the browser to the server, you can also post a Highcharts configuration in javascript and let PhantomJS generate the chart on the server. Read more on server-side rendering [here.](https://highcharts.com/docs/export-module/render-charts-serverside)

To make this work we need to run a headless browser, PhantomJS and PhantomJS needs in it's turn the Highcharts JS files on the server. For licensing reasons the Highcharts export server doesn't ship with Highcharts javascript files. We need to copy the Highcharts files manually to the project.

Save `highcharts.js` or `highstock.js` for stock charts, `highcharts-more.js` (for bubble, range, polar charts), `funnel.js` for supporting funnel charts, etc. to this location: `highcharts-export-server/java/highcharts-export/highcharts-export-convert/src/main/resources/phantomjs` It's recommended to use the Highcharts compiled files from [code.highcharts.com](https://code.highcharts.com)/[highcharts-version-you-use]/

The javascript files are already configured in the `resources.json` file which is used by PhantomJS to determine which files need to be injected to PhantomJS. If convenient, you can specify alternative paths in the `resources.json`. So make sure the resources.json matches the files you just copied in this step.

#### 1.4. Install the Highcharts-export module in your local Maven repository

Open a Dos/Shell prompt and navigate to the main folder of the export server, _highcharts-export_ and install it in your local Maven repository. This installs also all dependencies (libraries) for the module.

$ cd highcharts-export/
$ mvn install

#### 1.5. Building a .war file

After you have configured and installed the application, you can compile the project files. Open a commandline in a terminal or DOS and navigate to the `highchart-export-web` folder and while standing here, type the following in a terminal: mvn clean package

$ cd highcharts-export-web/
$ mvn clean package

After compiling and the message BUILD SUCCESS, you will find a file: highcharts-export-web.war in the `highcharts-export/highcharts-export-web/target` folder.


    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

     generated-sources        **highcharts-export-web.war**    surefire
     Gerts-MacBook-Pro:highcharts-export-web gert$

Upload/copy this to the application server. You're done with setting up the highcharts-export server!

#### 1.6. Some Tips

*   We added the Jetty Server dependency in pom.xml file for testing convenience. For running the export-server locally, during development, navigate in a DOS/Shell to the highcharts-export/highcharts-export-web folder, and run this command: `mvn jetty:run`. This starts the Jetty application server and the application is now accessible at `http://localhost:8080/export`.

*   Change you url property for the [exporting option](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#exporting.url) in your (javascript) highcharts configuration, and point it to the new installed exporting-server, otherwise it still points at Highcharts export-server at http://export.highcharts.com


        exporting:{
        url:'http://new.server.com/highcharts-export/'
        }
*   Remember to install necessary fonts on the server. When characters are missing, they will be displayed as squares on the exported charts. The application will automatically pick the fonts up after installation.

    Highcharts sets its font globally to Lucida Grande, so if you use for example a japanese font, you have to set the fontFamily to a japanese-able font with [Highcharts.setOptions](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#Highcharts.setOptions), for making the export work.

*   When having problems while using the export-server, the first thing you could do is to enable logging Debug messages. This can give you a clue of what's going wrong. To enable Debug messages, uncomment these lines in highcharts-export/highcharts-export-web/src/main/resources/log4j.properties



    \# Debug specific class
     `log4j.logger.services=DEBUG`
     `log4j.logger.converter=DEBUG`
     `log4j.logger.exporter=DEBUG`
     `log4j.logger.pool=DEBUG`

*   **When running on WebLogic**

By default WebLogic registers its own `URLStreamHandler to handle http` URLs. This results in that the Connection silently returns and empty files being returned from the server. The solution is to get in a reference to Java's default `URLStreamHandler` instead of the one from WebLogic. Follow these steps

1. Alter this file: `highcharts-export\highcharts-export-convert/src/main/java/com/highcharts/export/server.Server.java`

Change line 94,95 from


    URL url = new URL("http://" + host + ":"
     + port + "/");

to


    sun.net.www.protocol.http.Handler handler = new sun.net.www.protocol.http.Handler();
    URL url = new URL(null, "http://" + host + ":" + port + "/", handler);

2. Goto the folder java/highcharts-export
3. Update your local maven repository, Run: `mvn install`
4. Goto the folder java/highcharts-export/highcharts-export-web
5. Create the .war file, Run: `mvn clean package`

### 2. EXPORT SERVER BASED ON PHP AND BATIK

Note that this export server omits server-side rendering. It can be used (only) to convert SVG files to images and PDF.

The `index.php` file that handles the POST can be downloaded from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-export-server/tree/master/php/php-batik).

1.  Make sure that PHP and Java is installed on your server.
2.  Upload the `index.php` file from the [exporting-server](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-export-server/tree/master/php/php-batik) repository to your server.
3.  In your FTP program, create directory called `temp` in the same directory as `index.php` and chmod this new directory to 777 (Linux/Unix servers only).
4.  Download Batik from the [Batik Distribution Mirror](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/batik). Find the binary distribution for your java version.

5.  Upload `batik-rasterizer.jar` and the entire `lib` directory to a location on your web server.
6.  In the options in the top of the index.php file, set the path to batik-rasterier.jar.
7.  In your chart options, set the [exporting.url](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/exporting.url) option to match your PHP file location.

#### TROUBLESHOOTING

If for any reason the export-server fails to export images, then consider pasting this code snippet to output error messages. Paste this before Line 78, beginning with the commenting text: `// Do the conversion.`


    // Troubleshoot snippet
    $command = "java -jar ". BATIK_PATH ." $typeString -d $outfile $width temp/$tempName.svg 2>&1";
    $output = shell_exec($command);
    echo "Command: $command <br>";
    echo "Output: $output";
    die;
