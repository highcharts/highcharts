Setting up your own export server
=================================

There may be cases where you don't want to use Highcharts' export server running at [export.highcharts.com](https://export.highcharts.com), for instance if you are running a secure website or if you don't want your data to be passed to the Highcharts CDN.Â 

Before setting up your own server, consider using the [client side export module](https://highcharts.com/docs/export-module/client-side-export). In short, a dedicated server is only needed if you are having problems with the features listed in the client side export browser support table.

Node export server
------------------

Install with `npm install highcharts-export-server -g` or clone from [https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server)

Documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/blob/master/README.md)

The export server running at [export.highcharts.com](https://export.highcharts.com) is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)\-based service, which is easy to install and integrate on any system. It accepts either chart configurations or SVGs, together with additional resources, and uses [PhantomJS](https://phantomjs.org/) to render charts to images (PNG, JPG, PDF and SVG) to be sent back to the user.

Update note - Puppeteer
-----------------------

We're excited to announce that our Puppeteer-based version of the Highcharts Export Server is now available on the **stable** branch on GitHub [here](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/tree/stable).

The new version (v3.0) has also been added to our [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts-export-server) so you can easily install it with `npm install highcharts-export-server`.

We're in the process of transitioning to fully replace the existing PhantomJS version. Soon, the Puppeteer-based server will be the default on both export.highcharts.com and the master branch on GitHub.

Here's the full [documentation](https://github.com/highcharts/node-export-server/tree/stable#readme).
