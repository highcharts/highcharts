Map series
==========

The `map` series is the basic series in Highcharts Maps offering the ability to create map shapes and operate on their values.

Initialize the constructor
------------


When setting the `mapChart` constructor, the default series `type` is `map`.
If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.
For an overview of the `map` series options see theÂ [API reference](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.map).

    Highcharts.mapChart('container', {
       ...
    });

Load the map
------------
Highcharts Maps loads its maps from GeoJSON.
A more detailed instruction on how to work with it is written here: [Load the map](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/maps/getting-started#load-the-map) 

Add and join data
-----------------
In this [link](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/maps/getting-started#add-and-join-data), you can find detailed descriptions of how to work with [series.map.data](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.map.data), and [series.joinBy](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/plotOptions.series.joinBy). 

You can also find there another way of joining the data by omitting [mapData](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.map.mapData) and setting the [path](https://api.highcharts.com/highmaps/series.map.data.path) directly on the data point.
