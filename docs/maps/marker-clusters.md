Marker clusters
===============

## Introduction
Marker clusters is the concept of sampling the data values into larger blocks in order to ease readability and increase performance. It is a simple solution to display a large number of map points on a map. The number label on a cluster graphic shows how many data points it represents. As you zoom into the map the individual points will start to show, and the cluster will contain fewer markers.

The `marker-clusters` module supports `mappoint` and `scatter` series types.
