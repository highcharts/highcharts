Tables
===

Including the [export-data](https://code.highcharts.com/modules/export-data.js) module will enable viewing the chart as a data table. This module also requires the [exporting](https://code.highcharts.com/modules/exporting.js) module.

```html
<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/modules/exporting.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/modules/export-data.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/modules/accessibility.js"></script>
```

Note that simply showing the chart data as a table is not considered a sufficient accessible alternative to a chart, and you should still enable the Accessibility module unless there is a specific reason not to do so.

See our [data-module documentation article](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/working-with-data/data-module) for more information on the data module and working with tables in Highcharts.
