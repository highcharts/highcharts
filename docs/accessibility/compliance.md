Compliance
===

Enabling the Accessibility module goes a long way to ensure that your charts comply with existing accessibility standards, including the Section 508 standard of the US Government, and the international WCAG 2.1 standard. We aim to be innovative and leading in this field, and make sure we involve users with disabilities when developing our accessibility features. The features provided go far beyond basic compliance, and our goal is to provide the most accessible charts possible.

Due to the flexible nature of Highcharts, however, the final responsibility for standards compliance has to be with the implementer. Certain design decisions, such as which colors are used in your chart, could potentially violate aspects of the standards. Custom plugins and new functionality could also affect chart accessibility. We therefore always recommend checking your design against established standards, and testing your charts with the latest screen readers to verify that they are accessible.
