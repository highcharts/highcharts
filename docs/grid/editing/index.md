# Editing overview

Editing in Grid is configured through `cells.editMode`. Use it to enable inline editing, choose how edit controls are rendered, and validate values before they are committed.

## Renderers

Renderers control which input is used when a cell enters edit mode, for example text input, number input, date input, checkbox, or select.

## Validation

Validation rules ensure edited values match your expected format and business constraints. You can combine built-in rules with custom validators and localized validation messages.
