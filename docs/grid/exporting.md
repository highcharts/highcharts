# Exporting Highcharts Grid

Highcharts Grid Pro supports exporting the grid data to CSV and JSON formats.

`Grid.exporting` provides methods for exporting grid data to CSV and JSON:

* `Grid.exporting.downloadCSV()`: Downloads the CSV string as a file.
* `Grid.exporting.getCSV()`: Returns the CSV string.
* `Grid.exporting.downloadJSON()`: Downloads the JSON string as a file.
* `Grid.exporting.getJSON()`: Returns the JSON string.

See the [API reference](https://api.highcharts.com/grid/#classes/Grid_Core_Grid.Grid#exporting) for more information on the `Grid.exporting` options.
