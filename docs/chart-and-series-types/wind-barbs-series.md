Wind barbs
===

Wind barbs visualize wind speed and direction in one graphical form. The stem direction defines the wind direction, while the barbsâ€™ numbers and shapes define the wind speed.

Data structure
--------------

Each wind barb point has an `x`, a `value`, and a `direction`.

The `value` sets the wind speed in meter per second. The resulting graphic, by convention, adds a full barb for each 10 knots (5,14 m/s) and a half barb for each 5 knots (2.57 m/s).

The `direction` is given in degrees, where 0 is a northerly wind, pointing towards the south.

Other options
-------------

*   **onSeries**: allows drawing the wind barb next to another series in the chart, typically a line or area series representing the wind speed. Otherwise, it is rendered on top of the X axis. For more details click [here](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.windbarb.onSeries).
*   **vectorLength**: sets the pixel length of the stems. For more details click [here](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.windbarb.vectorLength).
*   **yOffset** is a pixel offset, preventing the barbs from covering the underlying series or axis. For more details click [here](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.windbarb.yOffset).
