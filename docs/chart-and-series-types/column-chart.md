Column chart
============

Column charts display data as vertical bars. A feature of column charts allows for different data to be compared alongside one another.
It is similar to bar charts, the difference being that bar charts have a horizontal representation of the data.

The column chart has the same options as a [series](https://highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/series). For an overview of the column chart options see the [API reference](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column).

Histogram
---------

Column charts can be used to make histogram charts by setting the padding between points and groups to 0.

    
    plotOptions: {
        column: {
            pointPadding: 0,
            borderWidth: 0,
            groupPadding: 0,
            shadow: false
        }
    }
    

Note that borderWidth and shadows are also turned off in the example so the columns do not overlap.

Stacked Column chart
--------------------
An essential feature of column charts is to represent data as stacked columns. Read more about [stacking charts](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/stacking-charts).
