Histogram
===

A histogram series is a graphical representation of the data distribution. Histogram creates intervals (bins) and counts how many values fall into each bin.

_For more detailed samples and documentation check the [API](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.histogram)._

How to create a Histogram
-------------------------

The histogram requires the following module [modules/histogram-bellcurve.js](https://code.highcharts.com/modules/histogram-bellcurve.js).

The histogram series is a column series with no padding between the columns and with self-setting data. Unlike most other Highcharts series, the [data](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.histogram) property is not available - it is set internally based on the base series data (more precisely y values of the data).

Two steps are required to create an Histogram chart:

1. Set the series type to histogram 2. Set baseSeries to the right data seriesâ€™ id or index.

    
        series: [{
            type: histogram,
            xAxis: 1,
            yAxis: 1,
            baseSeries: 1
        }, {
            data: [3.5, 3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9, 3.4]
        }]
    

Histogram chart specific options
--------------------------------

A histogram series has two additional options:

*   **binsNumber**: to suggest how many bins the histogram should create. `binsNumber` can be a number or a function which returns a number or one of the string: `square-root`, `sturges` or `rice`.
*   **binWidth**: to control the width of each bin. `binWidth` takes precedence over `binsNumber`.

For the full set of options, [see the API](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.histogram).

Histogram using pre-aggregated data
-----------------------------------

A histogram chart can also be created using a column chart if the data is already pre-aggregated.  
Use the following setting to set up a histogram chart with a column chart:

    
    plotOptions: {
        column: {
            pointPadding: 0,
            borderWidth: 0,
            groupPadding: 0,
            shadow: false
        }
    }
