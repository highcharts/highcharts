Pareto chart
===

The pareto chart is used to graphically summarize and display the relative importance of the differences between groups of data. It suggests that 80% of problems can be traced to as few as 20% of root causes.

The Pareto series is represented by a line series of datapoints extracted from a base series, which is typically a column type. Calculated values are from the range: 0% - 100% and should be assigned to additional yAxis.

How to create Pareto Chart
--------------------------

Pareto chart requires the following module [modules/parallel-coordinates.js](https://code.highcharts.com/modules/parallel-coordinates.js).

Here are the steps to create a Pareto chart:

1. Set an additional yAxis, which is assigned only to Pareto series, and visualize points from 0-100% range. As a result the main data and pareto series are transparent.

    
    yAxis: [{
          // main yAxis
      },{
           title: {
           text: 'Pareto'
        },
        minPadding: 0,
        maxPadding: 0,
        opposite: true,
        labels: {
        	format: "{value}%"
        }
      }]
    

For more details about yAxis click on the following [link](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/yAxis).

2.Set a column series (sorted by y descending). Points are data source for the Pareto series.

    
    {
        type: 'column',
        data: [115, 75, 60, 55, 45, 30, 20]
    }
    

3.Add a pareto series with an baseSeries parameter and yAxis index.

    
    series: [{
    	  type: 'pareto',
    	  yAxis: 1, // number of declared yAxis
    	  zIndex: 10,
    	  baseSeries: 1 // index of column series
    	 }, {
    	  type: 'column',
    	  zIndex: 2,
              data: [755, 222, 151, 86, 72, 51, 36, 10]
    	 }  
    ]
    

Keep in mind that Highcharts will generate all necessary data points following its algorithm.

Keep in mind that `yAxis: [ … ]` options have higher priority than `chart.parallelAxes`.

Pareto chart options
--------------------

*   **baseSeries**: Index of a specific column series.
*   **yAxis** : Index of Pareto yAxis
