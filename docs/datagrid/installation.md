# DataGrid installation

## Install via NPM
One way to add Highcharts DataGrid to your web page is via npm script.
You can get all of the functionality of the datagrid through Highcharts Dashboards packages, which can be installed using the following script:
```bash
npm install @highcharts/dashboards
```
Then import the package into your project:
``` js
import DataGrid from '@highcharts/dashboards/datagrid';
```

## Include Highcharts DataGrid by script tag
Include the JavaScript files in your web page's `<head>` section, as shown below.

```html
<script src="https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/datagrid.js"></script>
 ```

In the example above, the Javascript files are loaded from [code.highcharts.com](https://code.highcharts.com), but you can download the files from [highcharts.com](https://www.highcharts.com/download/) and include them on your web page. Here is an example with Highcharts DataGrid loaded from your server:

```html
<script src="../code/dashboards/datagrid.js"></script>
```

## Importing the CSS
The CSS is not included in the library by default, but you can import it as below:
```css
@import url("https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/css/datagrid.css");
```
