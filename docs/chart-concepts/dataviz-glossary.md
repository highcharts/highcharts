# Dataviz Glossary

The Dataviz Glossary provides concise definitions of key terms and concepts
commonly used in data visualization. Whether you're new to charting or looking
to refresh your understanding of specific terms, this glossary serves as a quick
reference to enhance your knowledge and improve communication within the field
of data visualization.

### Cartesian coordinate system
- **Definition:** A coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely using a
pair of numerical values, typically denoted as (x, y), representing horizontal
and vertical positions on a two-dimensional plane.
- **Example:** Line and column charts in Highcharts commonly use the Cartesian
coordinate system to map data points.
- **Related Highcharts concepts:** [Axes](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/axes),
[Series](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/series).

### Choropleth map
- **Definition:** A thematic map that uses differences in shading, coloring, or
patterns within predefined areas (e.g., countries or regions) to represent the
magnitude of a variable, such as population density or income levels.  
- **Example:** A map showing average rainfall levels across regions, where
darker shades indicate higher rainfall.
- **Related Highcharts concepts:** [Map series](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/maps/map-series),
[Color axis](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/maps/color-axis).

### Mosaic plot
- **Definition:** A graphical display that uses rectangular segments to
represent categorical data. The area of each segment is proportional to the
frequency or proportion of the categories it represents. Also known as
**Marimekko** or **Mekko** chart.
- **Example:** Mosaic plots are used to display multi-dimensional categorical
data, where each rectangle size visually indicates the relationship between
different variables.
- **Related Highcharts concepts:** [Variwide series](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/variwide-chart),
[Treemap series](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treemap).

### Tree (data structure)
- **Definition:** A hierarchical data structure used to organize elements in a
parent-child relationship. Each element, called a node, can have multiple child
nodes but only one parent (except for the root node, which has none).
- **Example:**  Used to represent relationships such as organizational charts or
file directories. Tree maps and sunburst charts use tree data structures to
represent nested data.
- **Related Highcharts concepts:** [Treemap series](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treemap),
[Treegraph series](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/treegraph-chart),
[Sunburst series](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/sunburst-series).
