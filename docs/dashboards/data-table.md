# Data Table

A Data Table is a structured representation of data, consisting of columns and rows.
It offers methods for adding, removing, and manipulating columns and rows, as well as for accessing data from specific cells.  
Think of a Data Table as a grid where each row represents a record or entry, and each column represents a specific attribute or piece of information.


`DataTable` is an integral part of the `Dashboards` and the `DataGrid` bundle, which means it can be accessed from these two places. There is no need to load any additional modules.

## Creating a DataTable
There are a few ways to create a DataTable:

1. **From a DataPool**  
    The `DataPool` is the main entry point for data handling in Highcharts Dashboards. It handles incoming data and creates a `DataTable` to store the imported data.

    It can be created automatically when you create a Dashboard:
    ```javascript
    Dashboards.board('container', {
        dataPool: {
            connectors: [{
                type: 'CSV',
                id: 'my-connector',
                options: {
                    csvURL: 'https://example.com/data.csv'c
                }
            }]
            ...
    ```

    Or you can create it manually with connector options:

    ```javascript
    const dataPool = new DataPool();

    dataPool.setConnectorOptions({
        type: 'CSV',
        id: 'my-connector',
        options: {
            csvURL: 'https://example.com/data.csv'
        }
    });

    const dataTable = await dataPool.getConnectorTable('my-connector');
    ```


2. **From a `DataConnector`**  
   A `DataConnector` is a service that retrieves data from an external source and creates a `DataTable` to store the imported data.  
   The DataTable is accessible via the `DataConnector.table`

   ```javascript
    async function loadData() {
         const connector = new DataConnector.types.CSV({
              csvURL: 'https://example.com/data.csv'
         });

         await connector.load();

         const dataTable = connector.table;
    }
    ```

3. **Manually**  
   You can create a DataTable manually by providing the columns and rows.

   ```javascript
    const dataTable = new Dashboards.DataTable({
        columns: {
            x: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
            y: ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c']
        }
    });
    ```

4. **From a `DataModifier`**  
   A `DataModifier` is a service that modifies data in a `DataTable`. It can create a new `DataTable` with the modified data.

   ```javascript
    const sortModifier = new DataModifier.types.Sort({
        direction: 'asc',
        orderByColumn: 'City'
    });

    const table = new Dashboards.DataTable({
        columns: {
            Rank: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
            City: ['Sydney', 'Melbourne', 'Brisbane', 'Perth', 'Adelaide', 'Canberra'],
            State: ['NSW', 'VIC', 'QLD', 'WA', 'SA', 'ACT'],
            Population: [5259764, 4976157, 2568927, 2192229, 1402393, 453558]
        }
    });

    const tableModified = sortModifier.modifyTable(table.clone());
    ```


## Get operations
A DataTable offers several methods to access data, among some of the most common are:

- `getRow`- Returns a row with the specified index from the DataTable.
- `getRows`- Returns all or a number of rows.
- `getRowIndexBy`- Returns the index of the first row that matches the specified condition.
- `getColumn`- Returns a column with the specified name or alias from the DataTable.
- `getColumns`- Returns all or a number of columns.
- `getModifier`- Returns the modifier for the table.

And many more. For a full list of methods, see the [API documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/dashboards/#classes/Data_DataTable.DataTable-1).


## Set operations
A DataTable offers several methods to modify data, among some of the most common are:

- `setRow`- Sets cell values of a row.
- `setRows`- Sets cell values of multiple rows.
- `setColumn`- Sets cell values for a column.
- `setColumns`- Sets cell values for multiple columns.
- `setModifier`- Sets or unsets the modifier for the table.

See other available methods in the [API documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/dashboards/#classes/Data_DataTable.DataTable-1).

## Other operations
Other useful operations include:

- `clone`- Returns a clone of the table.
- `deleteColumns`- Deletes columns from the table.
- `deleteRows`- Deletes rows from the table.
- `on`- Adds an event listener to the table for a specific event.
