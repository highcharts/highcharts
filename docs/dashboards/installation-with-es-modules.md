Installation with ES6 modules
=============================

Highcharts Dashboards packages are available as ES6-compatible modules.

## Including a product package (ES6 module)

For debugging and development purposes, you can load core files directly from your
browser page and use tree shaking. Please note that this results in a
decreased download size but an increased delay caused by the amount of
(small) files to load. This approach is, therefore, not recommended for
production.

```html
    <script type="module">
        import Dashboards from 'https://code.highcharts.com/dashboards/es-modules/masters/dashboards.src.js';

        Dashboards.board('container', {
            editMode: {
                enabled: true,
                contextMenu: {
                    enabled: true
                }
            },
            gui: {
                enabled: true,
                layouts: [{
                    rows: [{
                        cells: [{
                            id: 'dashboard-col-0'
                        }]
                    }]
                }]
            },
            components: [
                {
                    renderTo: 'dashboard-col-0',
                    type: 'HTML',
                    elements: [{
                        tagName: 'h1',
                        attributes: {
                            text: 'Hello world'
                        }
                    }]
                }
            ]
        });

    </script>
```

## To load a plugin
A plugin is a third-party/community-made Highcharts Dashboards addon.
First, make sure that a plugin supports loading over NPM. Then, load the required files.
In the example, `DataGrid` supports NPM loading, so after installing the package, you could initialize and register it like this:

```ts
import Dashboards from '@highcharts/dashboards/es-modules/masters/dashboards.src';
import DataGrid from '@highcharts/dashboards/es-modules/masters/datagrid.src';

Dashboards.DataGridPlugin.custom.connectDataGrid(DataGrid);
Dashboards.PluginHandler.addPlugin(Dashboards.DataGridPlugin);
```
