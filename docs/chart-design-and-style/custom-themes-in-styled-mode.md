Custom themes in styled mode
===

Highcharts allows you to create your own custom chartsâ€™ theme using CSS.

The default the CSS file for [styled mode](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/style-by-css) is available as [/css/highcharts.css](https://code.highcharts.com/css/highcharts.css) on the root of `code.highcharts.com` as well as under version folders.

In the `highcharts.css` file, there are CSS variables for all the colors used in the chart, both for the data and for GUI elements like labels, borders and such. Use them to easily style the chart in the customs theme. As a result, there is no need to overwrite all CSS classes.

In addition to the data colors, Highcharts uses two ranges of colors called the neutral and the highlight colors. These range from a full contrast color with a weight of 100, to low-contrast variations with lower weight. You can use the [Palette Helper](https://www.highcharts.com/samples/highcharts/css/palette-helper) tool to generate these variations.


How to create your own theme
----------------------------


Follow the steps below to create a custom theme using CSS rules:

1.  Create a CSS file

2.  Use `@import` to load all default highcharts styles

3.  Re-declare CSS variables of the default `highcharts.css` file. For more fine-grained control over each element's appearance, declare individual classes.


Example of `yourtheme.css`


    @import 'https://code.highcharts.com/css/highcharts.css';

    /* This will re-declare variables globally */
    :root {
      --highcharts-color-0: #f45b5b;
    }

    /* This will overwrite variables for different charts */
    #container-1 {
      --highcharts-color-0: #f45b5b;
    }

    #container-2 {
      --highcharts-color-0: #dedede;
    }

    /* This will use a different variable for some elements, in this case a more
    contrasted color variation for the axis labels */
    .highcharts-axis-labels {
      fill: var(--highcharts-neutral-color-100);
    }

    /* Example of individual components overriding variables */
    .highcharts-title {
      fill: black;
      font-size: 26px;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

See our [CSS colors demo](https://www.highcharts.com/samples/highcharts/css/colors) for a boiler plate of experimenting with the default CSS. Highcharts since v11 also honors the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature by default, and it is recommended that you test your styling with both light and dark modes. See the [Style by CSS](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/style-by-css) article for how to disable or modify this.


Featured themes
---------------

Highcharts offers three different themes by default. There are available as CSS files at `code.highcharts.com/css/themes` :

*   [dark-unica.css](https://code.highcharts.com/css/themes/dark-unica.css)

*   [sand-signika.css](https://code.highcharts.com/css/themes/sand-signika.css)

*   [grid-light.css](https://code.highcharts.com/css/themes/grid-light.css)


Legacy
______
Prior to Highcharts v11, the CSS was generated from a SASS file
`highcharts.scss`. [Read the old docs](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/blob/v10.3.3/docs/chart-design-and-style/custom-themes-in-styled-mode.md) on how to set up and modify that.
