Getting started with Highcharts Stock
===

Highcharts Stock allows to create stock or general timeline charts for your web and mobile apps. Features sophisticated navigation for high-volume data, user annotations and over 40 built-in Technical Indicators.

Find demos of Highcharts Stock charts [here](https://highcharts.com/stock/demo) to quickly get an overview of Highcharts Stockâ€™s capabilities.

Get started
-----------

Load Highcharts Stock as a standalone library when there is no need for other Highcharts dependencies.

_Example of loading Highcharts Stock into a webpage_

    
    <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/stock/highstock.js"></script> 

Load Highcharts Stock as a module when a project needs both Highcharts and Highcharts Stock loaded at the same time. Place the script tag or import statement after loading the main library.

_Example of loading both libraries in a webpage_

    
    <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"></script>
    <script src="https://code.highcharts.com/stock/modules/stock.js"></script> 

For alternative loading and bundling patterns, for UMD, AMD, CommonJS or ES6 modules, find more information [here](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/blob/master/readme.md). Highcharts Stock follows the same patterns as described for Highcharts.

Constructor
-----------

Run the `stockChart` constructor for initializing a Stock chart visualization. The constructor takes two required parameters and a third optional parameter.

    
    Highcharts.stockChart('container', {
        // configuration options
    }, myCallback); 

1.  `id:` The `id` of the HTML element used for rendering the chart.
2.  `config`: An object with configuration options for defining the Stock chart.
3.  `callback`: Optional, a callback for getting a handle on the chart, after rendering.
