OHLC chart (Highcharts Stock only)
================

The Open-High-Low-Close chart is typically used to show the change in price over a period of time. A vertical line shows the range of the price change where the top of the line is the highest and the bottom is the lowest. A tickmark on the left side of the chart indicates the opening price and a tickmark on the right side indicates the closing price.
