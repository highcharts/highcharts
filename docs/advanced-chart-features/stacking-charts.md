Stacking charts
===============

Column and area type series can be set to stack on top of each other instead of overlapping. Most of the series support two available options, `"normal"` stacking and `"percentage"` stacking.Â Normal stacking stacks the data series on top of each other in order. Percent stacking fills the plot area and draws each point of data with a relative percentage to all the points in the same category.

Two series supports additional types of stacking:
- `"overlap"` in waterfall, allowing negative and positive values to overlap each other
- `"stream"` in streamgraph, where stacking is displaced around the central x axis

Here is an example of `"normal"` stacking:
