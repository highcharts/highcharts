Highcharts TypeScript Declarations (beta)
===

Highcharts 7 is the first release with support for TypeScript through declarations files. TypeScript-compatible editors can give you now tooltips and suggestions for Highcharts as you type. The TypeScript compiler watches and points out potential problems while coding, and results in a faster and better fail-proofed development cycle for your Highcharts-based solutions.

Installation
------------

You need a TypeScript-capable Editor, like Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, for getting autocompletion and hints for Highcharts.

Configuration
-------------

Highcharts is a charting library most often used in the web browser and in that case you probably need to modify the TypeScript configuration for the target platform. The `tsconfig.json` below, covers a typical use case of Highcharts:

    
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            "strict": true,
            "target": "es6",
            "module": "umd",
            "moduleResolution": "node",
            "outDir": "mychart/",
        },
        "exclude": [
            "node_modules"
        ]
    } 

If you place your TypeScript source code (`*.ts`) in one of your project folders, the TypeScript compiler will automatically find it, compile it and output the JavaScript compiled code (`*.js`) to the `outDir` folder. With the `exclude` property you prevent specified folders from compiling to TypeScript, for example files found in the `node_modules` folder.

Migration
---------

### Migration from Definitely Typed

If you previously used TypeScript declarations for Highcharts like `@types/highcharts`, you should uninstall them to prevent any mismatch:

    
    npm uninstall @types/highcharts 

### Migration from JavaScript

For full fail-proofed development you may convert your project's source code to TypeScript. The initial step is:

    
    npm install typescript && npx tsc --init 

More information about migrating JavaScript projects to TypeScript can be found in the official [TypeScript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/migrating-from-javascript.html).

Solving Problems
----------------

### Debugging

If TypeScript is complaining about your Highcharts options, then it might not find the correct series as a reference. If that is the case, cast the series options to the correct type and you get more helpful error messages:

    
    series: [{
        type: "line",
        data: [1, 2, "3", 4, 5] as Highcharts.SeriesLineDataOptions
    }] 

### Missing Modules

Sometimes there isn't a TypeScript declaration for a Highcharts module available. Then cast the module and unknown functions to the `any` type. Create first a `global.d.ts` file in your root folder with the following file content:

    
    declare module '*'; 

After that, you can use all JavaScript modules and cast the Highcharts namespace as required. For example:

    
    import * as Highcharts from 'highcharts';
    
    // Module with declaration:
    import AccessibilityModule from 'highcharts/modules/accessibility';
    
    // Module with any type:
    import NewModule from 'highcharts/modules/new';
        
    NewModule(Highcharts);
    AccessibilityModule(Highcharts);
        
    // Initiate the chart
    (Highcharts as any).newChart('container', {
        series: [{
            type: 'new',
            data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        }]
    }); 

### Reporting Bugs

The TypeScript declarations for Highcharts are in a beta state. They can be used in production, but we can't guarantee your code from breaking with future type updates. In that case, probably small modifications to the types will be necessary. If you found something in TypeScript that is not working as in our [documentation](https://api.highcharts.com/) or [demos](https://www.highcharts.com/demo), you can create an [issue report](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/issues) to inform us.

Extending Highcharts in TypeScript
----------------------------------

The Highcharts libraries come with a huge amount of possibilities right out of the box, but for a special use case you might need to extend default behavior of Highcharts. Extending Highcharts in TypeScript follows a straightforward pattern as illustrated with the below example.

### Steps

*   Set proper types for your extensions
*   Declare additional interfaces with your extensions to the Highcharts namespace
*   Make use of existing [Highcharts types](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts) and [interfaces](https://api.highcharts.com/class-reference/Highcharts.Dictionary_T_)
*   For a deep dive into TypeScript declaration take a look at the official [TypeScript guide](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/deep-dive.html).

### Example

If you like to have a custom highlight function for you data points, you could come up with the following code. You might notice, that the beginning code is actually not real TypeScript and instead is just common ECMAScript, widely known as JavaScript:

    
    import * as Highchart from 'highcharts';
    
    Highcharts.Point.prototype.highlight = function (event) {
        event = this.series.chart.pointer.normalize(event);
        this.onMouseOver(event);
        this.series.chart.tooltip.refresh(this);
        this.series.chart.xAxis[0].drawCrosshair(event, this);
    }; 

First you have to make TypeScript aware of the types in your function, so you have to specify the type of the `event` parameter in this example:

    
    [...]
    Highcharts.Point.prototype.highlight = function (
        event: Highcharts.PointerEvent
    ) {
    [...] 

Secondly assure TypeScript, that creating a new function on `Highcharts.Point` is really made by intention. You can do this with declarations for the Highcharts namespace - in a separate file like `./global.d.ts` or directly in your code:

    
    [...]
    declare module 'highcharts' {
        interface Point {
            highlight: (event: Highcharts.PointerEventObject) => void;
        }
    }
    [...] 

In the end the source code of the example would look like this:

    
    import * as Highchart from 'highcharts';
    
    declare module 'highcharts' {
        interface Point {
            highlight: (event: Highcharts.PointerEventObject) => void;
        }
    }
    
    Highcharts.Point.prototype.highlight = function (
        event: Highcharts.PointerEvent
    ) {
        event = this.series.chart.pointer.normalize(event);
        this.onMouseOver(event);
        this.series.chart.tooltip.refresh(this);
        this.series.chart.xAxis[0].drawCrosshair(event, this);
    };
