# Rolling Return

This type yields rolling return time series data for single or multiple securities.

Returns rolling return time series data for securities specified.

When multiple securities are sent, the start date of the first security 
in the list is used as the start date for the series.

## How to use Rolling Return

In order to fetch a rolling return time series, specify series type 
`RollingReturn` in the Time Series Connector options.

```js
const dividendConnector = new HighchartsConnectors.Morningstar.TimeSeriesConnector({
    postman: {
        environmentJSON: postmanJSON
    },
    series: {
        type: 'RollingReturn'
    },
    securities: [{
