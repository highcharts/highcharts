Working with data
=================

In Highcharts core, you specify the data through the [series.data](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/series.line.data) option directly on the configuration object. However, this is not always the simplest way to add data, for example if you are loading data from a CSV file, a HTML table or a Google Spreadsheet.

In most of these cases you can use our built-in data parsing features from the _Data module_. Alternatively, if you don't have control over the data structure, you may need to preprocess the data by setting up your own _data parser_.

We will cover the following topics:
