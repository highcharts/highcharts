		<h1>Sample viewer and test tool for Highcharts</h1>

		<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/tree/master/utils#tests">GitHub readme file</a> 
				for guidelines on setting up the tests.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Use the icon next to the sample to either compare against a previous version, or to run a unit test. Unit tests
				are marked with a jigsaw puzzle icon.</li>
			<li>By default, visual tests compare against the latest stable release.
				To compare against a specific commit in a visual browser, set the <code>leftPath</code> to the commit id in the <code>settings.php</code>
				file.</li>
			
			<li>Tests can also run in <strong>PhantomJS</strong>, which is faster than a visual browser. Run <code>gulp test</code> from the root folder. If there are errors, they can be inspected in a browser by clicking "View
				results for PhantomJS" at the top left. Use the <code>--commit</code> argument to run the visual tests against a
				specific commit, for example when you are testing an uncommitted bug fix against the latest commit.</li>
