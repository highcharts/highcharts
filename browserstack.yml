# BrowserStack Reporting
# ======================
# The following capabilities are used to set up reporting on BrowserStack:
# Set 'projectName' to the name of your project. Example, Marketing Website
projectName: Highcharts
# Set `buildName` as the name of the job / testsuite being run
buildName: highcharts build 
# `buildIdentifier` is a unique id to differentiate every execution that gets appended to
# buildName. Choose your buildIdentifier format from the available expressions:
# ${BUILD_NUMBER} (Default): Generates an incremental counter with every execution
# ${DATE_TIME}: Generates a Timestamp with every execution. Eg. 05-Nov-19:30
# Read more about buildIdentifiers here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/organize-tests
buildIdentifier: '#${BUILD_NUMBER}' # Supports strings along with either/both ${expression}

# =======================================
# Platforms (Browsers / Devices to test)
# =======================================
# Platforms object contains all the browser / device combinations you want to test on.
# Entire list available here -> (https://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms/automate)
platforms:
  - deviceName: Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
    browserName: chrome # Try 'samsung' for Samsung browser
    osVersion: 12.0
    
# =======================
# Parallels per Platform
# =======================
# The number of parallel threads to be used for each platform set.
# BrowserStack's SDK runner will select the best strategy based on the configured value
#
# Example 1 - If you have configured 3 platforms and set `parallelsPerPlatform` as 2, a total of 6 (2 * 3) parallel threads will be used on BrowserStack
#
# Example 2 - If you have configured 1 platform and set `parallelsPerPlatform` as 5, a total of 5 (1 * 5) parallel threads will be used on BrowserStack
parallelsPerPlatform: 1

# ==========================================
# BrowserStack Local
# (For localhost, staging/private websites)
# ==========================================
# Set browserStackLocal to true if your website under test is not accessible publicly over the internet
# Learn more about how BrowserStack Local works here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/local-testing-introduction
browserstackLocal: true # <boolean> (Default false)
# browserStackLocalOptions:
# Options to be passed to BrowserStack local in-case of advanced configurations
  # localIdentifier: # <string> (Default: null) Needed if you need to run multiple instances of local.
  # forceLocal: true  # <boolean> (Default: false) Set to true if you need to resolve all your traffic via BrowserStack Local tunnel.
